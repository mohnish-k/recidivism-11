# Recidivism Project

### **Description**
The **Recidivism Project** aims to address the problem of recidivism by utilizing machine learning models and various data analysis techniques. This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting recidivism in individuals using datasets, including processing text, generating embeddings, and performing query-based searches using the FAISS library for efficient nearest-neighbor search.

The project also includes tools for building a chatbot using OpenAI's API, which interacts with data stored in a vector index for querying and providing responses related to recidivism.

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohnish-k/recidivism-11.git
   cd recidivism-11
