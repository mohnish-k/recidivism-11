Objective: The current study examined the ef ﬁcacy of an early intervention based on acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT) for depressive symptomatology. The ACT intervention is aimed at increasing
the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions and living a mindful and value-based life.
Method: Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to the ACT
intervention ( n¼49) or to a waiting list (n ¼44). The mean age of the participants was 49 years. The
majority of the participants was female and of Dutch origin. All the participants completed measuresbefore and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess depression (CES-D),
anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS), alcohol use and acceptance (AAQ-II).Results: The ACT intervention led to statistically signi ﬁcant reduction in depressive symptomatology
(Cohen ’sd¼.60). These reductions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Also signi ﬁcant
reductions in anxiety and fatigue were observed. Moreover, mediational analysis showed that theimprovement of acceptance during the intervention mediated the effects of the intervention ondepressive symptomatology at follow-up.
Conclusion: These ﬁndings suggest that an early intervention based on ACT, aimed at increasing accep-
tance, is effective in reducing depressive symptomatology.

Introduction
Depression makes a large contribution to the burden of disease
worldwide and is the leading cause of the burden of disease in
middle- and high-income countries ( World Health Organization,
2008 ). Depression is also associated with high economic costs
and increased use of health services (e.g., Cuijpers, Smit,
Oostenbrink, et al., 2007; Von Korff, Ormel, Katon, & Lin, 1992 ). In
the last decades many effective treatments for depression have
been developed ( Cuijpers, Van Straten, Smit, Mihalopoulos, &
Beekman, 2008 ). However, even when the current evidence-
based treatments would be optimally implemented, only 40% of the
burden of depression will be avoided ( Andrews, Issakidis,Sanderson, Corry, & Lapsley, 2004 ). Pro-actively offering preven-
tive interventions to people in the community is thereforea necessary complementary strategy for decreasing the burden of
disease ( Hosman, Jane-Llopis, & Saxena, 2005 ). Particularly indi-
cated preventive or early interventions are promising ( Cuijpers,
Smit, & Van Straten, 2007; Cuijpers et al., 2008; Smit, Ederveen,
Cuijpers, Deeg, & Beekman, 2006 ). These interventions aim at
people who suffer from clinically relevant symptoms but who donot meet the criteria of a clinical disorder ( Mrazek & Haggerty,
1994 ). The presence of depressive symptomatology can be seen
as the most important risk factor for developing a clinical depres-
sion ( Cuijpers & Smit, 2004 ). Early interventions in the form of
workshops, courses or self-help can be attractive for people whoare not in need of psychotherapy or medical treatment as yet ( Jorm
& Grif ﬁths, 2006 ).
In the last years several early interventions have been developed
(e.g. Lynch, Tamburrino, & Nagel, 1997; Willemse, Smit, Cuijpers, &
Tiemens, 2004 ). Most interventions are based on cognitive
behavior therapy and on the ‘Coping with Depression ’course in
particular ( Lewinsohn, Antonucci, Breckenridge, & Munoz, 1984 ). In
this 12-week group course psycho-education is combined with*Corresponding author. Tel.: þ31 53 489 6098; fax: þ31 53 489 2388.

several mood management techniques. Cuijpers, Smit, and Van
Straten (2007) found a mean effect size of .42 of seven interven-
tions on depressive symptoms.
For early interventions to be effective, a clear model of risk
factors and mechanisms in the development of psychopathology is
needed ( Rapee, 2008 ). There is growing evidence that in addition
to symptoms of depression, experiential avoidance (EA) is sucha mechanism involved in depression and other psychopathology.
EA has been de ﬁned as the unwillingness to remain in contact with
experiences such as feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, as anattempted means of behavioral regulation ( Hayes et al., 2004 ). A
meta-analysis of 32 studies examining the relationship between EAand psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder,
pain, depression) found a weighted effect size of r¼.42 (95% CI:
.40e.44) ( Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006 ). Additionally,
EA has been found to mediate the effects of maladaptive coping
behavior on psychopathology and positive mental health
(Fledderus, Bohlmeijer, & Pieterse, 2010; Kashdan, Barrios, Forsyth,
& Steger, 2006 ).
So, early interventions targeting EA and clinically relevant
symptoms of depression are warranted from a public mental health
perspective ( Biglan, Hayes, & Pistorello, 2008 ). One intervention
that has been speci ﬁcally developed for targeting EA in patients
with depression is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT
is a form a behavioral therapy that focuses on decreasing EA and
increasing value-based behavior ( Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999 ).
Several studies have shown medium to large effects of clinical ACTtreatments on depression (e.g., Forman, Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans,
& Geller, 2007; Lappalainen et al., 2007 ).
However, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on
the ef ﬁcacy of ACT as an early community intervention for people
with clinically relevant depressive symptoms. A group course based
on ACT was developed, called “Living to the full ”and was pro-
actively offered to the general public. This paper presents theresults of a randomized controlled trial with a waiting list as
a control group, in which the efﬁ cacy of this ACT intervention was
assessed for reducing depressive symptomatology. In addition, wewere also interested in symptoms of anxiety and fatigue, and the
degree of alcohol use. A secondary goal of this paper was to test the
effects on EA as an important process factor of ACT.
MethodProcedure and participants
The group intervention was designed as an early intervention for
adults of 18 years and older with mild or moderate psychological
distress. Study participants were recruited from March to May 2008
through press articles, lea ﬂets and posters, and through psycholo-
gists at seven mental health institutions in the Netherlands. In theseadvertisements the target group of the intervention was described
as people who want to live more fully but who are hindered by
depressive symptoms.140 individuals responded and were assessed
for eligibility by trained psychologists in clinical face-to-face inter-views. Participants with more severe psychological distress and
therefore in need of therapeutic treatment were excluded and
referred to a mental health institution. Other exclusion criteria
were: (a) currently undergoing treatment at a mental health insti-
tution; (b) started less than three months ago with psychophar-
macological treatment; (c) reporting no psychological complaints or
symptoms; or (d) missing two or more sessions of the intervention.
47 individuals were excluded on the basis of these criteria. After
signing informed consent, the remaining 93 participants were
randomly assigned to the ACT intervention ( n¼49) or to a waiting
list ( n¼44). An independent researcher carried out the blockrandomization for the two groups with strati ﬁcation
on gender and
age (<50 and /C2150 years), using a computer-generated random
sequence of numbers. Participants completed measures on threeoccasions: at baseline (T0), post-treatment at two months (directly
after the intervention) (T1), and follow-up at 5 months after baseline
(T2). Fig. 1 provides an overview of the ﬂow of participants. There
were 75 (80.6%) participants who ﬁlled out the questionnaires three
times. The drop-out rate for the intervention was 14.3% (7 out of 49).
Table 1 shows an overview of the participants’ characteristics. The
mean age of the study participants was 49 years (range ¼24e71).
The majority was female (81.7%) and of Dutch origin (91.4%). They
varied in education: 26.9% had less than 13 years of education, 39.8%
more than 16 years and 33.3% in-between. Furthermore, 46.2% was
married and 52.7% had a paid job.
Measures
All assessments included a primary measure of depression,
secondary measures of anxiety, fatigue and alcohol use and EA as
a process measure.
Primary measure
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-
D(Radloff, 1977 ) is a 20-item questionnaire that measures depres-
sive symptoms in the general population. Respondents rate on a 4-
point scale ranging from hardly ever (less than 1 day ) (0) to
predominantly (5 e7 days) (3) to what extent they had experienced
depressive symptoms in the previous week. Summation of the
scores results in a total score ranging from 0 to 60. A score of 16 or
higher is considered to indicate the presence of clinically relevant
depressive symptoms. The CES-D showed adequate psychometric
properties ( Radloff, 1977 ). The Dutch translation showed similar
psychometric properties in a group of elderly people in theNetherlands ( Haringsma, Engels, Beekman, & Spinhoven, 2004 ). The
scale showed high internal consistency in this study (
a¼.88, T0).

Secondary measures
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale (HADS-
A).The HADS-A ( Zigmond & Snaith, 1983 ) is a 7-item questionnaire
that assesses the presence and severity of anxious symptoms.Respondents rate on a 4-point scale ranging from not at all (0) to
often (3) to what extent they had experienced anxiety symptoms in
the previous week. The total HADS-A scores range from 0 to 21. The
Dutch translation showed good psychometric properties ( Spinhoven
et al., 1997 ).Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, and Neckelmann (2002) showed
that an optimal balance between sensitivity and speci ﬁcity was
achieved when caseness was de ﬁned by a score of 8 or above. The
scale showed high internal consistency in this study (
a¼.83, T0).
Checklist Individual Strength (CIS). The CIS ( Vercoulen, Alberts, &
Bleijenberg, 1999 ) is a Dutch 20-item questionnaire and measures
four aspects of fatigue: subjective fatigue, concentration, motiva-
tion and activity. Only the subscale of subjective fatigue (8 items)
was measured in this study, because this scale indicates the severity
of fatigue. Respondents rate on a 7-point scale ranging from yes, that
is correct (1) to no, that is not correct (7) to what extent they had felt
fatigue in the last two weeks. The summation of the scores gives an
indication of the severity of fatigue: <27 indicates normal fatigue,
27e35 indicates heightened fatigue and >35 indicates severe
fatigue. The CIS showed good convergent and discriminant validity,
and showed high internal consistency in this study ( a¼.93, T0).
Alcohol use was measured by assessing the number of standard units
of alcohol consumed in the preceding week. Respondents rated how
many standard units they drank during each of the last 7 days. These
were summated to calculate the weekly alcohol consumption.
Process measure
Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II). The AAQ-II ( Bond
et al., submitted for publication ) is a 10-item measure of EA. The
AAQ-II assesses on a 7-point scale ranging from never true (1) to
always true (7) the subject’ s willingness to be in contact with
negative private events, the acceptance of these events, and
whether they can live according to their values. Summation of the
scores results in a total score ranging from 10 to 70, whereby
a higher score indicates higher acceptance and less EA. The Dutch
AAQ-II showed a good factor structure in a general and clinicalpopulation in the Netherlands and good internal consistency in the
current study ( a¼.86, T0) ( Jacobs, Kleen, de Groot, & A-Tjak, 2008 ).
Intervention
ACT
The intervention ‘Living to the full ’consists of eight two-hour
weekly sessions. It is a group-based intervention with on average
seven participants per group. The intervention was provided by
seven teams of two licensed psychologists. These psychologists
work at prevention departments of mental health care institutes.
All psychologists received a three-day training that was given by
two clinical psychologists with ample experience in ACT.
The intervention is based on six core processes of ACT: will-
ingness to experience negative emotions and thoughts, cognitive
defusion, contact with the present moment, self as context, values,
and committed action ( Hayes et al., 2006 ). In session 1, the basic
principles of ACT are explained and participants are encouraged tothink about what they really want in life. This is a ﬁrst exploration
of their values. In sessions 2 and 3, the participants re ﬂect on the
avoidance and control strategies they are using and whether these
strategies are effective in the long run. In sessions 4, 5, and 6, the
participants learn how to come into contact with their present
experiences, without trying to avoid or control them. Cognitive
defusion and experiencing self as context are practised. In the last
two sessions, the focus is on becoming aware of the most important
personal values and making decisions based on these values. In all
sessions participants learn mindfulness skills based on mindful-
ness-based stress reduction ( Kabat-Zinn, 1990, 1994 ).
Waiting-list control
Study participants assigned to the waiting list received no
intervention. After the study ended, these participants were invitedto take part in the ACT intervention.
Statistical analyses
The statistical analyses were done using SPSS 17. Independent-
samples t-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to examine
differences between the treatment conditions at baseline.Table 1

Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS
Missing Value Analysis to impute all missing data on the contin-
uous measures with the expectation-maximization (EM) method.
This method computes missing values based on maximum likeli-
hood estimates using observed data in an iterative process
(Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977 ). The total percentage of missing
data was 10.47% due to unanswered items (.43%) or incompleteassessments (10.04%). These missing values at baseline, post-
treatment and follow-up were imputed. Hence, all participants that
were randomized were included in the statistical analyses. A
comparison of results based on the imputed intention-to-treat
sample versus the observed data revealed similar outcomes.
Therefore, only the results from the intention-to-treat analyses are
reported.
All measures had a normal distribution, except for the measure
of alcohol use. To describe this measure, the measure of alcohol
consumption was transformed into a dichotomous variable using
the current Dutch guideline ( Health Council of the Netherlands,
2006 ), according to which a weekly alcohol consumption of 21 or
more standard units per week (for men) and 14 or more (for
women) was de ﬁned as alcohol misuse. For analyzing, the differ-
ence in reported alcohol use between baseline and post-treatment
and follow-up was calculated. The non-parametric Mann eWhitney
test was used to assess whether this change in alcohol use wasdifferent between the ACT group and the waiting-list group. To
measure the effects for the other measures, analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) were conducted with the baseline scores as covariates.
Comparisons were two-tailed and interpreted with a signi ﬁcance of
p<.05.
Effect sizes at post-treatment and follow-up were calculated
with Cohen ’sdusing the means and the pooled standard deviations
of the measurements of the conditions. To interpret Cohen ’sdan
effect size of d¼.2 was considered small, d¼.5 was considered
medium and d¼.8 was considered large ( Cohen, 1992 ).
In order to examine whether a reduction in EA (or an
improvement in acceptance) during the intervention would
mediate the effects of the intervention on depressive symptom-
atology at follow-up mediational analysis with bootstrapping
procedures ( n¼5000 bootstrap resamples) were used to assess the
indirect effect of the mediational pattern outlined by Preacher and
Hayes (2008) . As prescribed, an indirect effect was considered
signiﬁcant in the case zero was not contained in the 95% con ﬁdence
interval.Results
Baseline characteristics
The means and standard deviations for the measures of
depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS) and EA (AAQ-II)
are presented in Table 2 . There were no signi ﬁcant differences at
baseline between the ACT group and the waiting-list group for anyof the demographic variables or outcome measures, indicating
a successful randomization.
The baseline scores of the participants on depression, anxiety
and fatigue consistently show clinically relevant symptoms in at
least two-thirds of the sample. The scores on acceptance are
considerably lower than was found in a general Dutch population
(Jacobs et al., 2008 ), meaning that the participants score high on EA.
Most
participants reported a safe use of alcohol, and 29 participants
drank no alcoholic beverages. In the ACT intervention 8 participants
were reporting alcohol misuse and on the waiting list 10
participants.
Intervention attendance
The average number of sessions attended by ACT participants
that started with the intervention ( n¼47) was 7.06, with a range of
2e8. There were 27 ACT participants that attended all the sessions.
Treatment adherence
At the time of the study, a standard measure of therapist
adherence was not yet available. However, the therapists at every
mental health institution were asked to note in a logbook afterevery session whether they performed all parts of the session. In
total, 88.1% of all the exercises and 92.7% of all the mindfulness
exercises were performed in the 8 sessions.
Primary outcome
The results of the ANCOVA as well as the corresponding effect
sizes are presented in Table 2 . An ANCOVA covarying the baseline
assessment of depression, showed signi ﬁcant differences between
the groups at post-treatment and at follow-up with more reduction
in depression in the ACT intervention compared to the waiting-list

group. Results for Cohen ’sdshowed medium effect sizes at post-
treatment and at follow-up.
Secondary outcomes
A signi ﬁcant difference between the groups was observed for
anxiety at post-treatment and follow-up with a greater decrease in
anxiety in the ACT intervention. Results also showed that the ACT
group had more reduction in fatigue at the post-treatment and at
follow-up compared to the waiting-list group. Medium effects sizes
were found at post-treatment and at follow-up for the secondary
outcomes.
A Mann eWhitney test, using the dichotomous criterion for
alcohol misuse, showed no effects of the ACT intervention on
alcohol misuse from baseline to post-treatment and follow-up.
Process outcome
Participants in the ACT intervention showed a greater reduction
in EA (or improvement in acceptance), both at post-treatment and
at follow-up compared to the waiting-list group. Medium effect
sizes were found at post-treatment and at follow-up.
Mediational analyses with EA
The results of the mediational analysis are presented in Table 3 .
Step 1 in Table 3 shows that, controlling for CES-D and AAQ-II at
baseline, the ACT intervention signi ﬁcantly reduced depressive
symptomatology at follow-up. Step 2 in Table 3 shows that the
improvement of AAQ-II from baseline to post-treatment signi ﬁ-
cantly predicted scores on the CES-D at follow-up. The treatment
effect is reduced with 43% and becomes non-signi ﬁcant. Media-
tional analysis, following Preacher and Hayes (2008) showed that
the mediating effect of improvement of AAQ-II from baseline to
post-treatment is signi ﬁcant ( p<.05), with bootstrapping values
between /C04.10 and /C0.67.
Discussion
Depression is one of the most prevalent disorders in the world.
In order to reduce this prevalence, a public mental health approach
is needed in addition to effective treatment in clinical settings
(Hosman et al., 2005 ). In this study it was found that a small-group
course based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) hasbeneﬁ cial effects on depressive symptoms and may be useful in
such a public mental health approach. Among ACT participants theaverage level of depressive symptomatology decreased signi ﬁ-
cantly to a level below the cut-off score (16) for clinical relevantlevels of symptoms ( Radloff, 1977 ), while among the waiting-list
control group depressive symptoms remained well above this cut-off score. This effect was maintained at three-month follow-up. As
the presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms is knownto be an important risk factor for clinical depression ( Cuijpers &
Smit, 2004 ), this outcome suggests that early treatment with ACT
may decrease the risk of developing a (next) full clinical depression.
This risk is also associated with experiential avoidance (EA) ( Biglan
et al., 2008; Hayes et al., 2006; Kashdan et al., 2006 ). The ACT
intervention speci ﬁcally targeted EA. In this respect it is meaningful
that medium effect sizes were found on EA, and that a reduction inEA during the intervention mediated the treatment effect on
depressive symptoms at three-month follow-up. This implies that
longer term effects of ACT are mediated by the effects on EA. This
ﬁnding corroborates the underlying theoretical model on which
ACT is built.
In
addition to depressive symptoms, the intervention showed
similar effects on symptoms of anxiety and fatigue. The reduction infatigue is an important ﬁnding, because fatigue is related to both
poorer psychological and physical health ( Cardol, Bensing, Verhaak,
& de Bakker, 2005 ). These ﬁndings suggest that an early interven-
tion based on ACT may play a role in reducing a broad spectrum ofpsychological distress. This is consistent with earlier studies that
found that EA is related to a wide variety of measures of psycho-
pathology ( Hayes et al., 2006 ). No signi ﬁcant reduction in alcohol
use was found. Possibly, this outcome is due to low statistical power
on this secondary outcome, as 18 of 93 participants reported
hazardous alcohol consumption, and a binary outcome measure
was used in the analyses.
This study corroborates the ﬁndings of earlier studies that
showed that ACT is effective in substantially reducing depressive
symptomatology of community dwelling people ( Forman et al.,
2007; Lappalainen et al., 2007 ). The results also support ﬁndings
from previous studies that early interventions implemented as
a course (e.g. the Coping with depression course) can substantially
reduce depressive symptomatology ( Cuijpers, Smit, Oostenbrink,
et al., 2007 ). To our best knowledge this is the ﬁrst study that
explored the effects of a similar course based on ACT.
It was recently discussed that early interventions, in order to have
a large impact on public mental health, should have a number of
characteristics ( Cuijpers, Van Straten, Warmerdam, & Van Rooy,
2010 ). An intervention should be offered in a framework that
reduces the stigma associated with depression, because this is one of
the main reasons people are unwilling to participate. Furthermore,
the intervention should also focus on other mental illnesses for
reaching larger groups for preventive services. We think that ACT is
especially suited for these types of early or indicated preventive
interventions. First, ACT is based on a positive health model and not
on a disease model ( Hayes et al.,1999 ). This allows an intervention to
be framed positively more easily. Second, ACT targets a risk factor, EAthat is relevant for various mental illnesses and thus may have
a broad trans-diagnostic impact ( Hosman et al., 2005 ). This was
conﬁrmed by our study. However, more elaborate studies are needed
to substantiate this claim. Another interesting focus for future
studies is the question whether early treatments are more effective
in participants who are at risk of a ﬁrst-time depressive episode than
in participants with a history of chronic or recurrent episodes.
Limitations
Several important limitations have to be pointed out. First, no
diagnostic instruments were used in the study, so it was unclear
how many participants suffered from a mental disorder before and
after the intervention. Also, our study relied on self-report
measures and used no clinician ratings. Second, the number of
participants using psychopharmacological treatment longer than
three months prior to baseline and changes in psychopharmaco-
logical doses was not assessed. Third, the use of a waiting list as
a control group is sub-optimal because confounding by nonspeci ﬁcTable 3

factors cannot be controlled for. This implies that the effects on the
outcome and process measures cannot be assigned to the speci ﬁc
ACT components. Furthermore, we did not assess the outcomes ofparticipants in the waiting list after they had received the inter-
vention because we included a three-month follow-up period for
both the intervention group and waiting-list group and because
of budgetary restraints. However, performing a post-treatment
assessment in the waiting-list group would add further evidence of
the ef ﬁcacy of the intervention if it can be shown that depressive
symptoms were reduced to a similar level as the intervention groupat post-treatment. Fourth, due to the relative short follow-up
period data on sustained effects are not yet available. Fifth, treat-
ment adherence was not assessed by independent evaluators who
have been trained to assess reliability.
Conclusion
Despite the limitations, it can be concluded that the ﬁndings
provide initial support for ef ﬁcacy of an early intervention based on
ACT within a public mental health approach. The intervention Living
to the full has now been implemented in about 50% of Dutch mental
health care institutes. Further research is needed to determine the
efﬁcacy of this intervention, for example among different pop-
ulations. This research should preferably include the use of diagnosticinstruments, an active control group and a longer follow-up period.

About ACT
Psychological Inflexibility: An ACT View of Suffering and Failure to Thrive
The core conception of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)  or (as it is usual called outside of a therapy
context, Acceptance and Commitment Training ...  also ""ACT"") is that psychological suf fering and a failure to
prosper psychologically is usually caused by the interface between the evolutionarily more recent processes of
human language and cognition, and more ancient sources of control of human behavior , particular those based
on learning by direct experience. Psychological inflexibility is ar gued to emer ge from six basic processes. Stated
in their most general fashion these are emotional inflexibility , cognitive inflexibility , attentional inflexibility ,
failures in perspective taking, lack of chosen values, and an inability to broaden and build habits of values-based
action. Buttressed by an extensive basic research program on an linked theory of language and cognition,
Relational Frame Theory (RFT), ACT  takes the view that trying to change dif ficult thoughts and feelings in a
subtractive or eliminative way as a means of coping can be counter productive, but new , powerful alternatives
are available to deal with psychological events, including acceptance, cognitive defusion, mindful attention to
the now , contacting a deeper ""noticing"" sense of self or ""self-as-context"", chosen values, and committed action.
These six flexibility processes are ar gued to be inter -related aspects of psychological flexibility . Each of these in
turn can be extended socially . For example, acceptance of emotions can extend to compassion for others; chosen
values can extend to social values; a ""noticing"" sense of self to healthy social attachment; and so on.
The ACT Model
ACT  is an orientation to behavior change and well-being that is based on functional contextualism  as a
philosophy of science, and behavioral and evolutionary science principles as expanded by RFT . As such, it is not
a specific set of techniques or a specific protocol. ACT  methods are designed to establish a workable and
positive set of psychological flexibility processes in lieu of negative processes of change that are hypothesized to
be involved in behavioral dif ficulties and psychopathology including
cognitive fusion -- the domination of stimulus functions based on literal language even when that process
is harmful,
experiential avoidance -- the phenomenon that occurs when a person is unwilling to remain in contact with
particular private experiences and takes steps to eliminate the form or diminish the frequency of these
events and the contexts that occasion them, even when doing so causes psychological harm
the domination of a conceptualized self over the ""self as context"" that emer ges from perspective taking and
deictic relational frames
lack of values, confusion of goals with values, and other values problems that can underlie the failure to
build broad and flexible repertoires linked to chosen qualities of being and doing
inability to build lar ger and lar ger unit of behavior through commitment to behavior that moves in the
direction of chosen values
and other such processes. Technologically , ACT  uses both traditional behavior therapy techniques (defined
broadly to include everything from cognitive therapy to behavior analysis), as well as others that are more recent
""3rd wave"" methods, and those that have lar gely emer ged from outside the behavior tradition, such as cognitive
defusion, acceptance, mindfulness, values, and commitment methods.
Research Support
Research seems to be showing that these methods are beneficial for a broad range of clients  and positive
psychological goals as well, not just in mental health areas but also in behavioral health, and social wellness
areas. ACT  teaches clients and therapists alike how to alter the way psychological experiences function rather2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 1/118
than having to eliminate them from occurring at all. This empowering message has been shown to help clients
cope with a wide variety of clinical problems, including depression, anxiety , stress, substance abuse, and even
psychotic symptoms; to step up to the challenges of diet, sleep, exercise, or the behavioral challenges of physical
disease; to help address social problems such as stigma or prejudice; or to seek positive outcomes in areas like
relationships, cooperation, business, social justice, climate change, gender bias, and so on. The benefits are as
important for the clinician as they are for clients. ACT  has been shown empirically to alleviate therapist burnout,
for example. By focusing on processes of change what began as a way of dealing with mental health issues is
now a model that is used to understand and change human behavior more generally .
How Do You Learn and Apply ACT to Your Practice?
The list of resources below are a great, easy-to-access way to learn more about ACT , it's theoretical and
philosophical background. We recommend checking out these pages, as they will provide an important
foundation of knowledge. We've also compiled a list of ways to learn about ACT  by reading ACT  books, as well
as getting consultation from others as you begin to apply the work to your work and practice. This additional list
of resources  will help you do so as well. ACBS members are strongly encouraged to join the ACT  for
Professionals email listserv . Once on that listserv you can ask virtually any question, or raise virtually any issue,
and thousands of ACBS members will read it ... and you can almost be guaranteed of interesting and helpful
responses. We've found that members of this listserv are nearly eight times more likely to remain as ACBS
members over the years than those who are not on the listserv , and we think the reason is that listserv members
come to appreciate the value of being part of a helpful and values-based knowledge development community . If
you are not sure, join and lurk for a while. If you do not like it, it easy to step of f later on -- you can do so with a

Philosophical roots
Philosophical roots
Functional Contextualism
ACT  is rooted in the pragmatic philosophy of functional contextualism, a specific variety of contextualism that
has as its goal the prediction and influence of events, with precision, scope and depth. Contextualism views
psychological events as ongoing actions of the whole or ganism interacting in and with historically and
situationally defined contexts. These actions are whole events that can only be broken up for pragmatic purposes,
not ontologically .
Because goals specify how to apply the pragmatic truth criterion of contextualism, functional contextualism
differs from other varieties of contextualism that have other goals. ACT  thus shares common philosophical roots
with constructivism, narrative psychology , dramatur gy, social constructionism, feminist psychology , Marxist
psychology , and other contextualistic approaches, but its unique goals leads to dif ferent qualities and dif ferent
empirical results than these more descriptive forms of contextualism, seeking as they do a personal appreciation
of the complexity of the whole rather than prediction and influence per se.
ACT  itself reflects its philosophical roots in several ways. ACT  emphasizes workability as a truth criterion, and
chosen values as the necessary precursor to the assessment of workability because values specify the criteria for
the application of workability . Its causal analyses are limited to events that are directly manipulable, and thus it
has a consciously contextualistic focus. From such a perspective, thoughts and feelings do not cause other
actions, except as regulated by context.
Therefore, it is possible to go beyond attempting to change thoughts or feelings so as to change overt behavior ,
to changing the context that causally links these psychological domains.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

Theoretical roots
Theoretical roots
RFT : A Theory of Language and Cognition
ACT  is based on Relational Frame Theory (RFT), which is a comprehensive basic experimental research
program into human language and cognition. RFT  has become one of the most actively researched basic
behavior analytic theories of human behavior , with over 70 empirical studies focused on it tenets. In ACT ,
virtually every component of the technology is connected conceptually to RFT , and several of these connections
have been studied empirically .
According to RFT , the core of human language and cognition is the learned and contextually controlled ability to
arbitrarily relate events mutually and in combination, and to change the functions of specific events based on
their relations to others. For example, very young children will know that a nickel is lar ger than a dime by
physical size, but not until later will the child understand that a nickel is smaller than a dime by social
attribution. In addition to being arbitrarily applicable (a nickel is “smaller” than a dime merely by social
convention), this more psychologically complex relation is mutual (e.g., if a nickel is smaller than a dime, a dime
is bigger than a nickel), combinatorial (e.g., if a penny is smaller than a nickel and a nickel is smaller than a
dime then a penny is smaller than a dime), and alters the function of related events (if a nickel has been used to
buy candy a dime will now be preferred even if it has never actually been used before).
The applied implications of RFT  derived from the following key features:
1. Human language and higher cognition is a specific kind of learned behavior . RFT  researchers have shown
that arbitrarily applicable comparative relations (the nickel and dime situation just mentioned) can be
trained as an overarching operant in young children; similar evidence has emer ged with frames of
opposition and coordination.
2. Relational frames alters the ef fects of other behavioral processes. For example, a person who has been
shocked in the presence of B and who learns that B is smaller than C, may show a greater emotional
response to C than to B, even though only B was directly paired with shock
3. Cognitive relations and cognitive functions are regulated by dif ferent contextual features of a situation.
The primary implications of RFT  in the area of psychopathology and psychotherapy extend from the three
features just described. RFT  argues that:
1. verbal problem solving and reasoning is based on some of the same cognitive processes that can lead to
psychopathology , and thus it is not practically viable to eliminate these processes,
2. much as extinction inhibits but does not eliminate learned responding, the common sense idea that
cognitive networks can be logically restricted or eliminated is generally not psychologically sound because
these networks are the reflection of historical learning processes;
3. direct change attempts focused on key nodes in cognitive networks creates a context that tends to elaborate
the network in that area and increase the functional importance of these nodes, and
4. since the content and the impact of cognitive networks are controlled by distinct contextual features, it is
possible to reduce the impact of negative cognitions whether or not they continue to occur in a particular
form. Taken together , these four implications mean that it is often neither wise nor necessary to focus
primarily on the content of cognitive networks in clinical intervention. Fortunately , the theory suggests
that it is quite possible instead to focus on their functions.
RFT has proven itself successful so far in modeling higher cognition in a number of areas, and the
neurobiological data collected so far comport with the theory . RFT  is meant to be a comprehensive2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 3/118
contextualistic account of human language and cognition and thus its goals extend far beyond ACT  or even the
behavioral and cognitive therapies in general. Because all of the key features of the theory are cast in terms of
manipulable contextual variables, it has readily lead to applied interventions in such areas as education.

Theory of Psychopathology
Theory of Psychopathology
Core Problem Pr ocesses
From an ACT  / RFT  point of view , while psychological problems can emer ge from the general absence of
relational abilities (e.g., in the case of mental retardation), a primary source of psychopathology (as well as a
process exacerbating the impact of other sources of psychopathology) is the way that language and cognition
interact with direct contingencies to produce an inability to persist or change behavior in the service of long term
valued ends. This kind of psychological inflexibility is ar gued in ACT  and RFT  to emer ge from weak or
unhelpful contextual control over language processes themselves, and the model of psychopathology is thus
linked point to point to the basic analysis provided by RFT . This yields an accessible and clinically useful middle
level theory bound tightly to more abstract basic principles.
A core process that can lead to pathology is cognitive fusion, which refers to the domination of behavior
regulatory functions by relational networks, based in particular on the failure to distinguish the process and
products of relational responding. In contexts that foster such fusion, human behavior is guided more by
relatively inflexible verbal networks than by contacted environmental contingencies. This is fine in some
circumstances, but in others it increases psychological inflexibility in an unhealthy way . As a result, people may
act in a way that is inconsistent with what the environment af fords relevant to chosen values and goals. From an
ACT  / RFT  point of view , the form or content of cognition is not directly troublesome, unless contextual features
lead this cognitive content to regulate human action in unhelpful ways.
The functional contexts that tend to have such deleterious ef fects are lar gely sustained by the social / verbal
community . There are several. A context of literality treats symbols (e.g., the thought, “life is hopeless”) as one
would referents (i.e., a truly hopeless life). A context of reason-giving bases action or inaction excessively on the
constructed “causes” of one's own behavior , especially when these processes point to non-manipulable “causes”
such as conditioned private events. A context of experiential control focuses on the manipulation of emotional
and cognitive states as a primary goal and metric of successful living.
Cognitive fusion supports experiential avoidance -- the attempt to alter the form, frequency , or situational
sensitivity of private events even when doing so causes behavioral harm. Due to the temporal and comparative
relations present in human language, so-called “negative” emotions are verbally predicted, evaluated, and
avoided. Experiential avoidance is based on this natural language process – a pattern that is then amplified by the
culture into a general focus on “feeling good” and avoiding pain. Unfortunately , attempts to avoid uncomfortable
private events tend to increase their functional importance – both because they become more salient and because
these control ef forts are themselves verbal linked to conceptualized negative outcomes – and thus tend to narrow
the range of behaviors that are possible since many behaviors might evoke these feared private events.
The social demand for reason giving and the practical utility of human symbolic behavior draws the person into
attempts to understand and explain psychological events even when this is unnecessary . Contact with the present
moment decreases as people begin to live “in their heads.” The conceptualized past and future, and the
conceptualized self, gain more regulatory power over behavior , further contributing to inflexibility . For example,
it can become more important to be right about who is responsible for personal pain, than it is to live more
effectively with the history one has; it can be more important to defend a verbal view of oneself (e.g., being a
victim; never being angry; being broken; etc) than to engage in more workable forms of behavior that do not fit
that that verbalization. Furthermore, since emotions and thoughts are commonly used as reasons for other2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 4/118
actions, reason-giving tends to draw the person into even more focus on the world within as the proper source of
behavioral regulation, further exacerbating experiential avoidance patterns. Again psychological inflexibility is
the result.
In the world of overt behavior , this means that long term desired qualities of life -- values -- take a backseat to
more immediate goals of being right, looking good, feeling good, defending a conceptualized self, and so on.
People lose contact with what they want in life, beyond relief from psychological pain. Patterns of action emer ge
and gradually dominate in the person’ s repertoire that are detached from long term desired qualities of living.
Behavioral repertoires narrow and become less sensitive to the current context as it af fords valued actions.
Persistence and change in the service of ef fectiveness is less likely .

Quick & Dirty ACT Analysis of Psychological Problems
Quick & Dirty ACT  Analysis of Psychological Problems
Most psychological dif ficulties have to do with the avoidance and manipulation of private events.
All psychological avoidance has to do with cognitive fusion and its various ef fects.
Conscious control belongs primarily in the area of overt, purposive behavior .
All verbal persons have the “self” needed as an ally , but some have run from that too.
Clients are not broken, and in the areas of acceptance and defusion they have the psychological resources
they need if they can be harnessed.
To take a new direction, we must let go of an old one. If a problem is chronic, the client's solutions are
probably part of them.
When you see strange loops, inappropriate verbal rules are involved.
The value of any action is its workability measured against the client's true values (those he/she would
have if it were a free choice). The bottom line issue is living well, not having small sets of “good”
feelings.
Two things are needed to transform the situation: accept and move.

The Six Core Processes of ACT
The Six Core Processes of ACT
The Psychological Flexibility Model
The general goal of ACT  is to increase psychological flexibility – the ability to contact the present moment more
fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends.
Psychological flexibility is established through six core ACT  processes. Each of these areas are conceptualized
as a positive psychological skill, not merely a method of avoiding psychopathology .
Acceptance2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 5/118
Acceptance is taught as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Acceptance involves the active and aware
embrace of those private events occasioned by one’ s history without unnecessary attempts to change their
frequency or form, especially when doing so would cause psychological harm. For example, anxiety patients are
taught to feel anxiety , as a feeling, fully and without defense; pain patients are given methods that encourage
them to let go of a struggle with pain, and so on. Acceptance (and defusion) in ACT  is not an end in itself. Rather
acceptance is fostered as a method of increasing values-based action.
Cognitive Defusion
Cognitive defusion techniques attempt to alter the undesirable functions of thoughts and other private events,
rather than trying to alter their form, frequency or situational sensitivity . Said another way , ACT  attempts to
change the way one interacts with or relates to thoughts by creating contexts in which their unhelpful functions
are diminished. There are scores of such techniques that have been developed for a wide variety of clinical
presentations. For example, a negative thought could be watched dispassionately , repeated out loud until only its
sound remains, or treated as an externally observed event by giving it a shape, size, color , speed, or form. A
person could thank their mind for such an interesting thought, label the process of thinking (“I am having the
thought that I am no good”), or examine the historical thoughts, feelings, and memories that occur while they
experience that thought. Such procedures attempt to reduce the literal quality of the thought, weakening the
tendency to treat the thought as what it refers to (“I am no good”) rather than what it is directly experienced to be
(e.g., the thought “I am no good”). The result of defusion is usually a decrease in believability of, or attachment
to, private events rather than an immediate change in their frequency .
Being Pr esent
ACT  promotes ongoing non-judgmental contact with psychological and environmental events as they occur . The
goal is to have clients experience the world more directly so that their behavior is more flexible and thus their
actions more consistent with the values that they hold. This is accomplished by allowing workability to exert
more control over behavior; and by using language more as a tool to note and describe events, not simply to
predict and judge them. A sense of self called “self as process” is actively encouraged: the defused, non-
judgmental ongoing description of thoughts, feelings, and other private events.
Self as Context
As a result of relational frames such as I versus You, Now versus Then, and Here versus There, human language
leads to a sense of self as a locus or perspective, and provides a transcendent, spiritual side to normal verbal
humans. This idea was one of the seeds from which both ACT  and RFT  grew and there is now growing evidence
of its importance to language functions such as empathy , theory of mind, sense of self, and the like. In brief the
idea is that “I” emer ges over lar ge sets of exemplars of perspective-taking relations (what are termed in RFT
“deictic relations”), but since this sense of self is a context for verbal knowing, not the content of that knowing,
it’s limits cannot be consciously known. Self as context is important in part because from this standpoint, one
can be aware of one’ s own flow of experiences without attachment to them or an investment in which particular
experiences occur: thus defusion and acceptance is fostered. Self as context is fostered in ACT  by mindfulness
exercises, metaphors, and experiential processes.
Values
Values are chosen qualities of purposive action that can never be obtained as an object but can be instantiated
moment by moment. ACT  uses a variety of exercises to help a client choose life directions in various domains
(e.g. family , career , spirituality) while undermining verbal processes that might lead to choices based on
avoidance, social compliance, or fusion (e.g. “I should value X” or “A  good person would value Y” or “My2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 6/118
mother wants me to value Z”). In ACT , acceptance, defusion, being present, and so on are not ends in
themselves; rather they clear the path for a more vital, values consistent life.
Committed Action
Finally , ACT  encourages the development of lar ger and lar ger patterns of ef fective action linked to chosen
values. In this regard, ACT  looks very much like traditional behavior therapy , and almost any behaviorally
coherent behavior change method can be fitted into an ACT  protocol, including exposure, skills acquisition,
shaping methods, goal setting, and the like. Unlike values, which are constantly instantiated but never achieved
as an object, concrete goals that are values consistent can be achieved and ACT  protocols almost always involve
therapy work and homework linked to short, medium, and long-term behavior change goals. Behavior change
efforts in turn lead to contact with psychological barriers that are addressed through other ACT  processes
(acceptance, defusion, and so on).
Taken as a whole, each of these processes supports the other and all tar get psychological flexibility: the process
of contacting the present moment fully as a conscious human being and persisting or changing behavior in the
service of chosen values. The six processes can be chunked into two groupings. Mindfulness and acceptance
processes involve acceptance, defusion, contact with the present moment, and self as context. Indeed, these four
processes provide a workable behavioral definition of mindfulness (see the Fletcher & Hayes, in press in the
publications section). Commitment and behavior change processes involve contact with the present moment, self
as context, values, and committed action. Contact with the present moment and self as context occur in both
groupings because all psychological activity of conscious human beings involves the now as known.
A Definition of ACT
ACT  is an approach to psychological intervention defined in terms of certain theoretical processes, not a specific
technology . In theoretical and process terms we can define ACT  as a psychological intervention based on
modern behavioral psychology , including Relational Frame Theory , and evolutionary science, that applies
mindfulness and acceptance processes, and commitment and behavior change processes, to the creation of
psychological flexibility .

https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 7/118
Whatever a client is experiencing is not the enemy . It is the fight against experiencing experiences that is
harmful and traumatic.
You can't rescue clients from the dif ficulty and challenge of growth.
Compassionately accept no reasons—the issue is workability not reasonableness.
If the client is trapped, frustrated, confused, afraid, angry or anxious be glad—this is exactly what needs to
be worked on and it is here now . Turn the barrier into the opportunity .
If you yourself feel trapped, frustrated, confused, afraid, angry or anxious be glad: you are now in the
same boat as the client and your work will be humanized by that.
In the area of acceptance, defusion, self, and values it is more important as a therapist to do as you say
than to say what to do
Don't ar gue. Don't persuade. The issue is the client's life and the client's experience, not your opinions and
beliefs. Belief is not your friend.
You are in the same boat. Never protect yourself by moving one up.
The issue is always function, not form or frequency . When in doubt ask yourself or the client “what is this
in the service of.”

ACT Therapeutic Steps
ACT  Therapeutic Steps
Compassionately confront the unworkable agenda, appealing always to the client's experience as the
ultimate arbiter
Support the client in feeling and thinking what they directly feel and think already—as it is not as what it
says it is—and to find a place from which that is possible.
In the service of that goal, teach acceptance and defusion skills.
Help the client make a richer and less defended contact with the present moment, and with their own on-
going thoughts, feelings, and sensations.
Help the client contact a transcendent sense of self.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

Help the client become more consistently mindful.
Help the client move in a value direction, with all of their history and automatic reactions.
Help the client detect traps, fusions, and strange loops.
Repeat, expand the scope of the work, and repeat again, until the clients generalizes.

Common Misunderstandings About ACT / RFT
Common Misunderstandings About ACT  / RFT
Here are a number of common misunderstandings about ACT  and RFT  and CBS. I've listed only ones that I
think are demonstrably false. Ones that could be true I have not listed since this page is about
misunderstandings, not legitimate weaknesses. Comments follow each. If you know of others, let me know -
Steven Hayes
ACT  is just _____ (fill in your  favorite: Buddhism, CT , BT, CBT , Logotherapy , a psychology of the
will, Gestalt, existential, est, Morita, constructive living, solution focused therapy , Kelly r ole therapy ,
and so on and so on)
Resemblance is a fun game to play but I have yet to have anyone say these things in strong form (it is just
_____) when they have really delved into the philosophy , theory , data, and technology . It is actually a
positive sign when you see that others are pointing to somewhat similar issues. If multiple paths lead in a
direction perhaps that is a direction worth exploring. If folks want to draw the connections above, it would
be good to do them seriously and in print so people can understand the connections. The only ones I could
see myself fully agreeing to is ""ACT  is just behavior analysis"" ... or , properly understood, ""ACT  is just
behavior therapy ,"" but I'd quickly want to add ""but that area itself has to be understood in a dif ferent way
to say that."" As far as roots, some of these are indeed influences on ACT . You could find some historical
connections with CT , BT, CBT , Logotherapy , Gestalt, existential, and est for example. Maybe Buddhism if
you mean ""estern thought"" -- as a child of the 60's it would be hard to avoid that. Probably a few more and
as it expands lots of new things come in. ACT  is a vast community now .
ACT  is a cult
James Herbert has a great powerpoint on this site walking through why that comparison is unfair and
inaccurate. Cults are closed of f; they avoid criticism; they are hierarchical; they suppress open expression.
ACBS is the exact opposite in all of these areas.
ACT  is just the latest fad
ACT  will ultimately die, as will we all, and it may indeed do so in a matter of decades or sooner , as what
is worthwhile inside it become better understood and enters into the mainstream (that process of
assimilation is happening at light speed right in front of our eyes), but if you mean that it is frivolous or
insubstantial, that is just factually incorrect. When you last 35 years, do over 1000 basic and applied
studies, and train over 50,000 people, ""fad"" is just not an applicable term. Is it? Inside the ACBS
community we suspect that the applied and basic theory underlying ACT   and RFT  (etc) is wrong but that
is because so far in science all theories have ultimately been shown to be incorrect. We just don't know
where it is wrong yet ... but we are chasing that rabbit! Come help us prove ourselves wrong!
ACT  is new on the scene
It is just under 35 years old. The first ACT  workshop was given in 1982 at Broughton Hospital in North
Carolina.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 9/118
ACT  is old on the scene and thus its outcome studies should be __ times mor e
When I first posted this page in the early 2000s I had to explain our slow start, but now the criticism is just
so far out of date even that explanation seems unneeded. OK, here is the explanation I used to give: ACT
followed a dif ferent development path linked to philosophy , basic research, and process measurement.
There was a 14 year gap in outcome studies from 1986 to 2000. That gap should not be held against the
tradition because the detour was linked to even higher standards and goals. During that time, functional
contextualism, the psychological flexibility model, RFT , measures of psychological flexiblity , and a
contextual behavioral science approach were created -- and it seemed responsible to do that before larding
up with RCT s after the first 3 successful ones in the mid 1980s. ACT  is willing to be held to RCT -linked
standards but RCT s alone are not enough to create a progressive field. You need a theory and development
strategy that works. Once we had that better worked out we did indeed come back to outcome studies. If
you look at the outcome studies since 2000 it would be a hard case to make that ACT  does not care about
outcome data. In 2000 there were 3 RCT s in ACT  but it began to pick up in the mid 2000s. When I first
rewrote this page as 201 1 began it was up to 37 RCT s. Wow. Now it is five years later and I'm rewriting
the page again in early 2016. The number of RCT s is hard to say precisely because a new one appears
every week or less and no one can keep up anymore and still have a life. My best guess is that it is sliding
past 200 (I have 153 in a file but a new paper my students wrote for a class tells me that there are about 70
more studies I missed that are not in English). And meanwhile ACT  has more and more consistent
mediation outcomes than any approach in existence. Our guess is over 50 studies. And it is the ONL Y
psychotherapy with a vigorous basic science of cognition underneath it, with hundreds of studies on RFT .
An entire book has been written on the ACT  Research Journey (Hooper & Andersson,
2015: http://www .amazon.com/Research-Journey-Acceptance-Commitment-
Therapy/dp/1 137440163/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=14591 10186&sr=1-
1&keywords=ACT+research+journey). So, really , anyone suggesting we are slack in terms of research just
does not know what he or she is talking about. Counting all areas of CBS my best guess based on search
engines is that there are over 2000 studies if you apply a liberal set of search criteria and about 1000 if you
apply a strict set. 
ACT  seeks ridiculously high goals and thus is making grandiose pr edictions or  claims.  Aspirations
are not predictions or claims. Seeking a comprehensive account of behavior that would apply to all human
action has always been the goal of behavior analysis as is shown in things such as Walden II. Why is a
grand aspiration grandiose?
ACT  works only with the well-educated
There are many trials indicating ACT  is helpful for those who are poor , uneducated, intellectually
disabled, children, those diagnosed with psychotic disorders, and so on and on. This criticism comes
because the theory can be hard to understand (especially RFT). But we do not teach theory to client, we do
therapy . That is dif ferent.
ACT  works only for  white middle class Americans
There are ACT  studies from 15 countries includinging countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
Successful studies have been done with poor urban black populations; unemployed poor Asian American
populations; institutionalized South African blacks, etc. As of early 2016 there are 45 RCT s done on ACT
in Iran; over 30 RCT s in Korea. The outcomes are equally good. The criticism is simply invalid.
ACT  is not committed to science
Come on; wake up. Put in key ACT  and RFT  terms into the Web of Science or Google Scholar and look at
what is out there dude. Download the studies. It after you do all that you repeat this claim that within arm's
reach of me or you'd better be able to duck fast.
The ACT  resear ch base is weak
ACT  has drawn a lot of interest from funded researchers and ACT  funded studies are as good as any out
there. There are a lot of them too (perhaps 50 RCT s of that kind) and the outcomes are often (not always)
impressive. Yes, in some areas the research base is lean -- but ACT  is not just for one problem area. In
some areas, such as smoking or chronic pain, you'd have to distort the meaning of evidence to say that2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 10/118
they ACT  research base is weak. And these are areas where people have worked for years to dial in how to
move ACT  processes. So overall the research base seems impressive given the scope of ACT  work.
Having said that, we need to add three things. First, ACT  draws a lot of interest from students, the developing
world, or parts of the developed world without a grant infrastructure. These studies often have methodological issues (sample size;
controls; etc) but jeez, how do they DECREASE what we know if they ADD to what we know from the best studies? Can someone
please explain that to me? It happens IMHO only if people doing meta-analyses average methodology ratings. I'm sorry, that is just a
dumb idea. Sure, weight findings study by study in light of methodological issues. But if a person in Liberia shows that ACT is
helpful for problem x, and a huge grant-based study at a Western academic medical center with all of the bell and whistles showed
that ACT is helpful for that same problem, the one in Liberia added to what we know regardless of its weaknesses. It showed that
these approaches to not just apply to the western world, for one thing. It is fine to use the well controlled one to estimate effect sizes.
But don't average the methodology ratings from the two and then say that the overall knowledge is weak in problem area x because
the average methdology score is humble. Aaaagh. That is just stupid. Second, you need a string of studies in a given area with a given
population to learn how to move psychological flexibility processes. If the technology has weak outcomes but did not move the
processes, that is an unfortunate technology error, not a model failure. If you move the processes and the outcomes are poor that is a
model failure. Yes, there are technology failures in ACT, but usually with new populations, settings, or modes of delivery. I know of
no replicated model failures in 35 years of ACT / RFT / CBS research. Finally, some meta-analyses are biased. They are. Look at the
overall pattern of meta-analyses and look carefully for responses to meta-analyses. For example, Ost claimed in 2008 that 13 ACT
RCTs were weaker than 13 matched CBT RCTs; but then Gaudiano showed that effect was 100% due to grant funding, and
furthermore 12 of the 13 ACT studies published mediational outcomes while 1 of the 13 CBT studies did so. An objective reader
should reject Ost's comparison. You have to look at the criteria too. For example, if you rightly put ""well defined population"" on a list
of methodological criteria, and then in small print insist on a DSM diagnosis as the only metric for a ""well defined population,"" ACT
will look methodologically weaker due to intellectually defensible choices that the reader might not realize is at play. CBS
researchers generally despise the DSM. Including such a scoring approach behind an item will lead to a biased ""criterion"" (one that
even NIMH has abandoned!). But the reader has to dig deep to sniff out bias liek that when it is there -- and sometimes not matter
how much care, the reader will be bamboozled (e.g., if the ratings themselves have horrible kappas that are not reported). But the
ACT community does not lay back on such things. We keep asking for the information and we keep trying to understand findings. As
a reader: Keep your powder dry; be careful before leaping; look at the entire set of criticisms, responses, and meta-analyses; use your
best judgment.
ACT  is just a technology
It is a far more ... do your reading. It is a model linked to a philosophy , basic science, and a strategy of
development.
ACT  is just a philosophy
Ditto.
ACT  is just acceptance
Ditto.
ACT  is just commitment
Ditto.
ACT  is just acceptance and commitment
Aw, come on. This kind of thing comes from folks reading the titles of books and studies instead of books
and studies.
Acceptance is important because it is a way to change the content of emotion (so ACT  is really about
that)
The data suggest otherwise. Emotion do often change, but that change predicts behavioral outcomes more
poorly than changes in the functions  of emotions -- and sometimes good outcomes come without a change
in emotion within the extant ACT  literature.
Defusion is important because it is a way to change the content of thought (so ACT  is really about
that)2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 11/118
Double ditto. Same point. Also decent data supporting it.  Will thoughts change? Sure! RFT  is all about
changing thoughts and of course ACT  changes thoughts.
The ACT  model of cognition is no differ ent than any CBT  model -- it is just differ ent in its
terminology
If you believe that, have the courage to do your homework in detail and write it up in article form. Then be
prepared to have others go after your ideas. We have so far responded to every single serious criticism in
print in ACT  or RFT , so anyone can read the criticisms and the response and judge the ar guments. So far
no one, I mean no one, has made the claim above in a careful scholarly article. But it is not the ACT
world's obligation to prevent the claim from being made in the hallways of convention hotels or on
listserves. Even here we do what we can, however . You are reading exhibit A in that area.
Defusion is just distancing as that concept is used in CT
They are indeed related. That is one of the real historical sources of ACT . But in ACT  there are scores of
such techniques, the are emphasized a great deal, and they are put to a quite dif ferent purpose than in
traditional CT .
ACT  is just mindfulness as that concept is used by Buddhists or  ______ (fill in the blank)
ACT  is clearly broader at the level of theory and technology . Mindfulness is itself a broad term that ican
be vague if it is left at that level. That is why we have written 4-5 articles walking through the concept of
mindfulness and trying to come up with a tighter analysis of it. When defined in the right way , ACT  is a
mindfulness-based approach but it is more than that as well.
Defusion is just exposur e in a traditional sense
Research shows that defusion supports exposure. If you say it is exposure then you have expanded
exposure to conver most contact of human beings with events and that is troublesome. Besides exposure
itself is not well understood, and ACT  folks have a flexibility and pattern-based account of exposure that
comports with the ACT  model.
Acceptance is just exposur e in a traditional sense
Research shows that it supports exposure and appears to empower the impact of exposure. ACT  is an
exposure-based technology and we said in the first chapter on ACT  in 1987. But the ACT  view of
exposure is that it is or ganized contact with previously repertorie narrowing events for the purpose of
creating response flexibility . That is why our goal is teaching more flexible contact with private events and
more flexible patterns of responding. We want patients to be able to label emotions; to feel them openly;
and to be able to approach their values in action. The most recent work in traditional exposure in CBT  is
finally catching up that approach. We do not do exposure to reduce emotions (thought they usually are
reduced) -- but it turns out that is not why exposure works even in traditional CBT .
ACT  does not car e about the r elationship
We have a model of it; we teach it; we emphasize it. We have data showing that ACT  gets high aliance
scores; they predict outcome; but they are themselves explained in part by changes in
acceptance/defusion/valued action. So no only do we care about the relationship, we care enough to be
able to teach clinicans how to create powerful ones: create a psychologically flexibile relationship.
ACT  eschews meditation and contemplative practice
Contemplative practice is often in our protocols (about 40% of the RCT s); Guided meditations is in nearly
100% of the protocols; ACT  targets mindfulness at the level of process in multiple ways; it moves and is
mediated by these processes; psychological flexibility impacts the brain or telomere length (etc) similarly .
Now if you insist that mindfulness = sitting and following the breath, yes ACT  is mostly not that. But if
you insist on that narrow definition you now have to go to war with ancient mindfulness traditions too. Is a
koan about mindfulness? Is chanting? This is why I resisted the word ""mindfulness"" in early ACT  writing.
I did not want to enter into ar guments that were thousands of years old. ACT  cares about mindfulness as a
process.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

You should not mix behavioral pr ocedur es with ACT
The model says you should. ACT  is part of behavior therapy . With all due respect, you don't get to peel it
away from its model just because that makes you uncomfortable in your sorting of things into cubby holes.
If you do mix behavioral pr ocedur es with ACT  you now have a combined tr eatment
ACT  is a model. Since the model says you should do this, it does not become a combination treatment to
follow the model. In early ACT  work we often deliberately hobbled the model so we could be heard by
others (e.g., taking out formal exposure in studies on OCD). Times up. After 200 RCT s, no more hobbling
the model to avoid science critics and their cubby holes.
The other  aspects of ACT  add nothing to the behavioral elements
We know that these other elements are helpful and that they can support the behavioral elements. If you
mean that the other elements are inert, that is clearly untrue. We published a meta-analysis of the first 60
or so component studies and all of the components matter [Levin, M. E., Hildebrandt, M. J., Lillis, J., &
Hayes, S. C. (2012). The impact of treatment components suggested by the psychological flexibility
model: A meta-analysis of laboratory-based component studies. Behavior Therapy , 43, 741–756. DOI:
10.1016/j.beth.2012.05.003.]  More formal component analysese are beginning to appear [V illatte, J. L.,
Vilardaga, R., Villatte, M., Vilardaga, J. C. P ., Atkins, D. A., & Hayes, S. C. (2016). Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy modules: Dif ferential impact on treatment processes and outcomes. Behaviour
Research & Therapy , 77, 52-61. doi:10.1016/j.brat.2015.12.001]. And we know that all of the aspects of
the psychological flexibility model contribute to outcomes (McCracken and colleagues have a study on
that in the chronic pain area).
The data on traditional CBT  is far  stronger
Well, duh. Your father's retirement account is bigger than yours too. ACT  is part of the CBT  / BT  / BA
family but its specific research program takes a lar ge community to mount.  The CBS community is
focused on basic science, processes of change, micro-studies, prevention, social change, link to evolution
science, and so on and on. But dig deeper . The vast majority of what is specifically supported in traditional
CBT  is stuf f that ACT  folks agree with anyway . If you insist on drag race studies --OK. Be patient. But
you can't start outcomes studies in 2000 and expect 16 years later to have the same amount of data as the
biggest dog on the block. But our research productivity is now obvious for anyone to see. If you know
how to de searches 
It is sur ely safe to mix ACT  techniques with other  techniques I'm mor e comfortable with while I
wait passively to understand the model
Ah, no. Down that path lies chaos. It is such a poor model of scientific development. Understand first. Get
the data. Then add anything that makes sense for good theoretical and practical reasons, not just because
you feel like it. One great benefit we have in ACT : if the thinks you like to do already improve
psychological flexibility (measure it regularly) than by all means include those things.
When I do that I should be able to r ename it and get famous tomorr ow because what I added (her e
you can pick any of the other  misunderstandings -- r elationship, emotion, mindfulness, etc etc) is
obviously missing fr om the model
You can rename it and still come and talk at our conventions etc. We don't care about names. Some folks
in the CBS community call ACT  ""Acceptance Based Behavior Therapy"" for example. It turns out that
psychological flexibility still mediates the outcomes.  But branding helps people find the work so at least
rename it for a good reason (e.g., sometimes it make it hard to do meta-analysises). It's up to you.
You can mix ACT  with the cognitive elements of CT  / CBT  easily
With some, but be careful. Incoherence is not usually helpful and patients will detect the incoherence if it
is there.
It is safe to do r esear ch on ACT  without doing any training in ACT
Is it safe to do sur gery that way? You cannot read a book and do this well. Get some training. It is cheap
and available and non-proprietary . ACT  folks will collaborate and consult. Reach out.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

It is safe to criticize ACT  based on what you've heard about it fr om others who ar e not expert in it
What is it about reading carefully that is so aversive?
ACT  contains nothing new
If you've studied it thoroughly , just say it in print and say why you say that and let us all look at it
dispassionately . If you've not done your homework yet, see above.
ACT  is behavioral in an S-R sense
ACT  is actively hostile to S-R psychology .
ACT  is behavioral in a traditional behavior  analytic sense
ACT  / RFT  is part of behavior analysis, but RFT  changes everything. ACT  is part of post-Skinnerian
behavior analysis -- which is a new form. We call it ""contextual behavioral science."" Read the RFT  book
for why we say that.
For these r easons ACT  is not oriented toward cognition
200 studies on cognition later , how can folks still say that?! Come to a training at least.
For these r easons ACT  is not oriented toward emotion
Come to a training! Watch some tapes! Go look at my TEDx talk: www .bit.ly/StevesFirstTED
Because ACT  is br oadly applicable it is primarily based on a non-specific clinical pr ocess
The theory says why it is broadly applicable and the process data so far say it is successful due to specific
process changes. We now have socres of mediational analyses out or in press.
Anything that works for  such a br oad range of pr oblems must be bulls**t
The theory says why it is broadly applicable. Who are you to say a priori what nature is like?
Ther e are not many outcome studies on ACT
About 200 RCT s and scores more controlled time series designs and counting. 
ACT  / RFT  is a small minority
Maybe. But there are about 3000 folks on the ACT  / RFT  listserves and over 8000 in the association.
ACBS is bigger than ABCT  or ABAI. Its one of the the fastest growing associations of its kind out there.
Besides, minority or not, we are speaking of ideas and data, not politics.
ACT  proponents make excessive claims that go beyond the data
A quote would be nice.
ACT  is hierar chical and you have to pledge allegiance to a leader  to be involved with it
It's an open list serve; an open website; no certification of therapists; no cut goes to originators from
members/trainers/etc; you can get our protocols for free; anyone can become a trainer . There are more
ACT  books by others than by the originators, by far . This is just so unfair . Its a cartoon, and an ignorant
one at that.
ACT  processes have not been studied
Download the list of studies and read them. We think our process data are stronger than just about any
other approach in all of applied psychology , and our link to basic science is excellent.
RFT  can't explain anything other  models of cognition cannot explain
RFT researchers have explained phenomena that other approaches have had hard times with. For example,
we are learning how to establish a sense of self, we know a lot about how metaphor works, we know a
core process in human cognition. And it appears that RFT  programs raise IQs more dramatically than
anything else out there; it helps with acquisition of language in disabled children; it has better implicit
measures than anyone; it can predict who will suceed for fail clinically; etc.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

RFT  is just jargon
How much have you carefully read so far? Until you read carefully you cannot distinguish jar gon and a
technical language. RFT  has a techical language, but only when technical terms are needed. If you
disagree, pick a technical term and show how it is the same as a common sense one. Maybe there was a
slip.
ACT  is just jargon
Same reaction as above.
No one can understand RFT
Do the RFT tutorial  on this website. Yes the basic studies are damn hard to understand ... you are
languaging about language and that is just confusing. But it is not beyond anyone reading this website.
Physics is hard too -- so?
No one can understand ACT
You can. And ""understanding"" in a purely intellectual sense is not the point for clients anyway . Usually
what therapists mean when they say this is that they are afraid that if they don't understand it thoroughly
they can't do it ef fectively . Folks like Raimo Lappalainen have shown that ACT  works even when
delivered by beginning therapists who don't really understand it. In fact most of the outcome data on ACT
was not done with experienced ACT  therapists. It's a miracle these studies work at all -- but they do.
Understsanding does help: we have studies 
RFT  has little to do with ACT
ACT  and RFT  co-evolved. There are many , many links are there and in both directions. It is not a matter
of point to point correspondence and it should not be if we are right and applied and basic science should
relate in a reticulated way . 
ACT  folks don't want CT  people to be involved and they look down on them
Ask some CT  people who got involved in ACT  work what they think about how they were treated. Just
ask.
We don't know which components work because ther e are no dismantling studies
ACT  comes from an inductive tradition. Rather than wait decades for dismantling studies we've done over
60 technique building and micro-analytic studies (see the reference above) and every aspect of the model
has at least some tar getted research data. And we do have some studies that dismantle the methods to a
degree (an example was listed above)
I hate the enthusiasm of students who do these workshops -- it scar es me
We can all agree that enthusiasm is not the same as substance ... but suppose that enthusiasm is hostile to
substance? Besides this concern itself sounds emotional so why let emotions substitute for data just
because it is now your emotions we are talking about ( it scar es me ) ? Be consistent. If enthusism creeps
you out, try to make room for being creeped out, hang on to your legitimate skepticism, and follow the
data.
I just don't like ACT
See above.
Talk of spirituality in ACT  is cr eepy
It is treated as a naturalistic concept. ACT  is not a religion.
I don't want to be told my values
ACT  folks will never do that ... your values are your choice.
Ther e is no data on ACT  in gr oups
About a third of the RCT s on ACT  are done in groups, so that means scores of studies.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 15/118
ACT  works thr ough the same pr ocess as ____ (fill in your  favorite)
Show me the actual research please. The reverse is much more likely to be true so far (the psychological
flexibility model explains your favorite). But that is cool, no? Now that we know how things work we can
chase the outcomes together .
ACT  is not self-critical
Lurk on the list serve and see. Come to a WorldCon and see. 
Steve Hayes is a jerk -- I saw him do a mean joke or  a mean comment at ABCT  or ABAI
ACT  is not Steve Hayes -- there are scores of leaders in ACT  / RFT . Besides, distinguish the message from
the messenger . Some of us are confrontational about intellectual issues, but we don't go after people or
traditions: just ideas. The list serve NEVER has flame wars, and that includes toward others. We are just
playing hard. Why not? It is fun and can be helpful. Not everyone inside CBS plays the same way . if you
hate folks who like to ar gue, go to ACT  talks (etc) by softer folks. As for mean humor , sometimes roast
humor can slip across the line a bit, but we tease those we respect. In the ACT  community we use humor
to remind us all that this work is not about the muckity mucks (including those inside ACBS) ... it is a
shared enterprise and everyone is part of it who wants to be part and is willing to bring science based
values and caring to the table. If you come to an ACBS conference you will see that the ACT  / RFT
leadership is outright ridiculed in the ""follies"" and it is just great fun. Anyone has access to the stage. Even
cognitive therapists! : )
ACT  is crazy (or  my personal favorite variant since I'm writing this, Steve is crazy)
Ah, finally you are getting somewhere. But as that Time guy said in 2006 in the last line of the story on me
and on ACT   -- we may just be crazy enough to pull it of f. If you are nutty enough to want to help us,
come help us succeed!

Criticisms of ACT
Criticisms of ACT
Given the values of ACBS, there has been ef forts from the beginning of the ACBS community to encourage
responsible criticism, to give thoughtful critics a stage to speak to the group, of trying to respond thoughtfully in
writing to knowledgeable critics, and of trying to resolve issues empirically where possible. Criticisms of ACT
have appeared in published forms. The written criticisms of RFT  (and to a lesser degree, functional
contextualism) are extensive and in writing, as are the defenses. They can be found in the other sections of the
website.
Self-Criticism
Part of the core of the ACT  / RFT  tradition is the openness to criticism, including self-criticism. At the LaSalle
ACT  Summer Institute (Philadelphia, 2005) James Herbert gave a really solid paper walking through many of
the criticisms he knew about, under the title ""Is ACT  a fad?"" He considers not just whether the criticisms are
correct, but what those in the ACT  / RFT  community should do about them. You can look at that talk by clicking
on the link below .

Published Criticisms and Responses: An Ongoing Conversation  Below is a list of papers that have been
published criticizing ACT  as well as replies that have been published when available. If you know of other
criticisms or replies please email us or add a child page to this page.
Corrigan, P . (2001). Getting ahead of the data: A threat to some behavior therapies. The Behavior
Therapist, 24(9) , 189-193.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 16/118
This was the first strong criticism of ACT  published. Corrigan ar gued that the ratio of non-empirical
to empirical articles could be used to ar gue that third-wave CBT  was ahead of its data.
A reply:  Hayes, S. C. (2002).  On being visited by the vita police: A reply to Corrigan. The Behavior
Therapist, 25,  134-137.
The reply ar gued that the ratio of non-empirical to empirical articles could not be meaningfully used
as a measure of getting ahead of data since there were many good reasons to write theoretical
discussion pieces. Instead, actual claims that got ahead of the data had to be identified and none
have been. Pat has been helpful to ACT  researchers in various capacities over the years since that
article.
Corrigan, P . (2002) . The data is still the thing: A reply to Gaynor and Hayes. The Behavior Therapist, 25 ,
140.
Asmundson, G. J. G., & Hadjistavropolous, H.D. (2006) . Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in the
Rehabilitation of a Girl With Chronic Idiopathic Pain: Are We Breaking New Ground? Cognitive and

Hofmann, S. G. (2008) . Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: New Wave or Morita Therapy? Clinical
Psychology , Science and Practice, 5 , 280-285.
The theme of these two articles is that ACT  and other mindfulness-based treatments is the same as
CBT, and that ACT  is the same as Morita Therapy . After these articles were written Stefan Hofmann
was invited and funded to speak to the ACBS community in Chicago (2007). We had a great time in
respectful dialogue. Read more about this criticism in non-peer -reviewed settings and the ensuing
dialogue, click on the child page ""ACT  is Outright Taken from Morita Therapy""  below .
Öst, L. (2008) . Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Behaviour Resear ch and Therapy , 46(3) , 296-321.
This article is in part based on proactive  efforts by the ACBS community to encourage
knowledgeable criticism. Lars-Goran Öst has been invited and funded to come to several ACT
conferences beginning even before he was knowledgeable of ACT  work, given that he was asked to
play the role of an outside critic at the first World Conference in Linkoping, Sweden (2003). He was
later also invited to London (2006), and Enschede, The Netherlands (2009), that last invitation
coming after the article itself was available.
The theme of Lar -Goran's criticisms have been that ACT  research has methodological weaknesses,
and that it is not as well done as mainstream CBT  research. The latter was based on a comparison of
ACT  studies with a matched set of traditional CBT  studies. His conclusion is that ACT  is not an
evidence-based treatment.
Gaudiano r eply:  Gaudiano, B. A. (2009) . Öst's (2008) methodological comparison of clinical trials

Gaudiano r ejoinder:  Gaudiano, B. (2009b)  Reinventing the Wheel Versus Avoiding Past Mistakes
when Evaluating Psychotherapy Outcome Research: Rejoinder to Öst (2009). Brandon has replied
again in a piece self-published online (in an attempt to keep the conversation flowing without the
confines of the lengthy peer -review process).
The theme of the replies was that errors were made in Lar -Goran's matching and coding process,
resulting in a distorted comparison, and that ACT  studies are not weaker when resulting dif ferences
in population and funding are weeded out. Further , it is noted that ACT  is already listed by APA as
an evidence-based treatment. Lars-Goran admits that the two sets of studies are not matched in areas
such as funding, and that APA lists ACT  as evidence-based, but holds to his original views.
Arch, J. J., & Craske, M. G. (2008) . Acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral
therapy for anxiety disorders: Dif ferent treatments, similar mechanisms? Clinical Psychology: Science &
Practice, 5 , 263-279.
A reply:  Hayes, S. C. (2008).  Climbing our hills: A beginning conversation on the comparison of
ACT  and traditional CBT . Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 5 , 286-295.
The theme of the response was that ACT  is part of the CBT  tradition, but it is not possible to
compare intellectual similarities until CBT  says what it is. Ef forts of the authors to do so were
argued to change long standing mainstream views, which explain some of why the two could be
argued to be very similar . Both the critical article and response agreed that there were good
empirical issues to be explored.
Reflective of the tone of this dialogue, several ACT  researchers (Geor g Eifert, John Forsyth, Steve
Hayes, Mike Twohig) are doing work with Michelle Craske and her colleagues trying to study the
issues raised. Michelle has been invited to speak at an ACBS World Conference. She was not able to
come in 2009 but we hope to hear her in the future.

commitment therapy superior to established treatment comparisons?’  Psychotherapy &
Psychosomatics, 78,  380–381.
ACT  researchers have critically examined the method of the meta-analysis and have published a
response to the study , with a revised analysis. A counter response by Powers and colleagues is also
available. We invited Paul Emmelkamp to come to Enschede but he could not ... we hope to get him
to an ACBS conference in the future.
Replies to Critiques in General: Articles Describing the CBS Strategy  Extensive reviews of the issued raised
in this article are out or in press, but they are too extensive to simply call them ""replies."" The theme of the
articles (which you can read by clicking the link above) has been to describe the ACT  approach, its knowledge
development strategy and to show its distinctive features.
Steven Hayes  January 15, 2010 - 5:27am
Criticism: ""ACT  is Outright Taken fr om Morita Therapy""
Criticism: ""ACT  is Outright Taken from Morita Therapy""
In June 2008 list serve post to the Academy of Cognitive Therapy , Bob Leahy , 2008 President-Elect of ACBT ,
made this claim: ""Moreover , the claim for a new , unique model of treatment made by ACT  does not seem2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 18/118
justified. As some of those on this Listserve know , many of the ideas and techniques that Hayes has advanced are
directly taken from Morita therapy . And without attribution.  See http://en.wikipedia.or g/wiki/Morita_Therapy or
http://www .clcma.com/morita1.htm Pay attention to the discussion about mindfulness, acceptance, character ,
values, etc. This was 1928. That's a long time ago. Does this remind you of anything? Is this a coincidence?""
****************** This is a response written by Steve Hayes (on 6/29/08): The claim is false. Maybe folks in
recent years have added things that I am unaware of ... ACT  is a vast community .... but I am certain that no
concepts or methods in the formative work on ACT  came from Morita whatsoever . I never heard of Morita
therapy until well after the ACT  model was developed and published. I am not sure when I first heard of it but I
do recall that the person knew Japanese and told me that the English translations are not very accurate and they
had been made too much like CBT  by Westerners. That decreased my interest in reading the secondary sources.
The methods I saw in the limited reading I did (e.g., keeping depressed folks in sensory deprivation, etc) it just
seemed way too far away from our work to be useful, especially since I recall seeing no controlled data. We have
cited Morita several times as being relevant to the ACT  work, however . For example in Hayes, S. C., & Ju, W.
(1997). The applied implications of rule-governed behavior . Chapter in W. O'Donohue (Ed.), Learning and
behavior therapy  (pp. 374-391). New York: Allyn & Bacon, we said: ""Conversely , the more traditionally non-
empirical approaches, like Gestalt (Perls, 1969) and Morita (Morita, 1929), may be more consistent with the
basic behavioral literature on rule-governance."" Rather than a dark vision of scientific theft the more plausible
reason for the connection is that many traditions have gathered together things that seem to work, and some of
these overlap to a degree with ACT . ACT  is a more bottom up, Western science account but it has arrived at
places other traditions inhabit to a degree. That is particularly true with just about any Eastern tradition since all
you really need to overlap a bit with where ACT  ended up is mindfulness (which always includes acceptance
somewhere) and some kind of right action (values). Because of the history of development, ACT  partitions these
broad chunks into technical processes that are linked to a basic account. That quality is part of what distinguishes
ACT  from these traditions. ACT  is a model linked to a basic theory , clear philosophy , and successful applied
technology . In other words, what is most new about ACT  is that it is part of contextual behavioral science, with
all of the progressive features this brings.

Getting Beyond the Way of the Guru and Other Scientific Deadends
Getting Beyond the Way of the Guru and Other Scientific Deadends
ACT  is drawing a great deal of attention and many of the folks now connecting with the work are not behavior
analysts. In addition, behavior analysis itself is not necessarily evolving fast enough for visitors to see through to
its core and to its potential without a bit of a roadmap. Many of the folks who visit this site would recoil from
ACT's intellectual home base if dropped into an Association for Behavior Analysis convention, say , without a
friend. Much of what is there will seem foreign or even hostile to an ACT  / RFT  perspective. But do the same
with someone knowledgeable -- especially someone to help deal with the confusion because both mechanists and
contextualists co-exist inside this tradition and to help find the right resources -- and the vast majority of those
who connect with the ACT  work will see the relevance of behavior analysis. If the ACT  / RFT  agenda is
successful this problem will eventually resolve itself because RFT  (especially) and perhaps to a lesser degree
ACT  will move the home base itself. But we are not there yet. The grand strategy here is this (this is not so much
sequential and linear as it is an interconnected web): build the contextualistic wing of BA, build the RFT
research program, build the ACT  program, build the links between ACT  and RFT , build the other applied
extensions of RFT , use ACT  to draw mainstream clinical to the work, expose mainstream CBT  to the value of
RFT, expose mainstream cognitive psychology to the value of RFT  and use RFT  to do hard work in that area,
expose other areas of psychology (prevention, education, etc etc etc) to the value of ACT  / RFT  and use
ACT/RFT  to do substantial work in those areas, use the support for ACT  and RFT  to build support in academic
departments for basic behavior analysis, bump behavior analysis itself along, end up with a revitalized form of
behavior analysis inside the mainstream of psychology . Whew This is not politics, though it may look like it in
some of its features. It makes sense only if you believe that for the good of humanity functional contextual
psychology should play far more of a role in the future of psychology than it otherwise seems destined to, and
that to do that it needs not just to be understood but to develop itself. But if you look at the list above you will
see a problem. This agenda cannot work if the work begins and ends with ACT . The explosion of popularity of
ACT  is both a blessing and a danger . Folks come to the work and think it is just a neat technology . Some2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 19/118
immediately start to modify it based not on theory or development of needed processes but on comfort (I like
doing X, X is not in there, I will do ACT  + X). Some folks are doing ACT  studies without ever having been to an
ACT  / RFT  conference, or even an extended ACT  training, etc. So just when we have a chance to leverage
attention for even more dramatic change, we risk crumbling into incoherence. Once ACT  is a technology only , it
is done. Because then, how doe sit develop? If you just let the technology stay as it is you have: Option A. The
Way of the Empirically Supported T reatment Manual.  The technology is it. Sell the manuals. Validate them. Sell
them some more. Then let them gather dust. If you are going to let it develop then you have other options:
Option B: The W ay of the Guru.  A charismatic leader declares new things to be in or out. Yuck. Option C: The
Way of Politics.  Anything goes provided enough folks support it, thus create subgroups to support
innovations/styles/techniques etc. Eventually this option becomes Option B, or ACT  just splinters into
nothingness and you are left just with a name and canonical texts. Option D: The W ay of Scientific Battleships.
Anything goes provided you have some data. The kitchen sink is useful, too, so don't for get to throw that in.
And, way the way , where did those ideas you threw in come from in the first place? Ahhh. Hmmm. Brute force
science linked to commonsense cannot see through to the essence of things. Precision, but no scope. Eventually
this becomes a sequential version of Option A. There is another option. It is the way bieng followed in the ACT  /
RFT approach. ACT  is a model, based on processes and techniques that modify those processes. The processes
are linked to basic principles and a basic research program on those principles. All of that stands on a philosophy
of science and on an intellectual and methodological tradition. This is Option E: The W ay of an Evolving
Science.  But to do this, we have to take responsibility for it. Folks drawn into ACT , for example, need to take
seriously the possibility that overtime they will need to learn more about RFT , and then about behavior analysis
itself (even if they are, say , psychoanalysts, or existentialists, or cognitive therapists). If you force that too early
or too rudely and it is a barrier . But ignore it altogether , and it is a recipe for ultimate irrelevance. Thus ACBS.
Thus, the World Conferences. Thus this website. We cannot expect someone else to do it. Together , as a
community , we have to work together to create a progressive science more adequate to the challenge of the
human condition. - Steve Hayes

     - Derived Relational Responding  offers a series of revolutionary intervention programs for applied
work in human language and cognition tar geted at students with autism and other developmental
disabilities. It presents a program drawn from derived stimulus relations that you can use to help students
of all ages acquire foundational and advanced verbal, social, and cognitive skills. The first part of Derived
Relational Responding provides step-by-step instructions for helping students learn relationally , acquire
rudimentary verbal operants, and develop other basic language skills. In the second section of this book,
you'll find ways to enhance students' receptive and expressive repertoires by developing their ability to
read, spell, construct sentences, and use grammar . Finally , you'll find out how to teach students to apply
the skills they've learned to higher order cognitive and social functions, including perspective-taking,
empathy , mathematical reasoning, intelligence, and creativity . This applied behavior analytic training
approach will help students make many substantial and lasting gains in language and cognition not
possible with traditional interventions.

     - The ABCs of Human Behavior  offers the practicing clinician a solid and practical introduction to the
basics of modern behavioral psychology . The book focuses both on the classical principles of learning as
well as more recent developments that explain language and cognition in behavioral and contextual terms.
These principles are not just discussed in the abstract—rather the book shows how the principles of
learning apply in a clinical context. Practical and easy to read, the book walks you through both common
sense and clinical examples that will help you use behavioral principles to observe, explain, and influence
behavior in a therapeutic setting.

Biglan, A. (1995).  Changing cultural practices: A contextualistic framework for intervention r esear ch.
Oakland, CA: Context Press/New Harbinger .
This is begins to show how you might scale these issues to the level of cultural practices. If the ACT
model is correct, we either alter the prevalence of psychological inflexibility or we fail to help the human
condition. You can do that one at a time, or in formal prevention ef forts, but either way it is the same
bottom line. No change in prevalence = failure. So we need to think about how to measure this and
approach this wisely throughout the work we are doing.

ACT  Study Group for Beginners
How This Came About
In February 2004 several beginners, interested but little experienced with ACT , found themselves on the ACT
listserve. The idea arose for launching an on-line study group for beginners. Very soon 30 or more folks signed
in, and the “ACT  study group for beginners” was born.
Hayes, S. C., Strosahl, K., & Wilson, K. G. (1999). Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential
approach to behavior change. New York: Guilford Press.
We began reading the book chapter by chapter , and discussing it on the listserve. The first, theoretical part was
tough. Kate Partridge raised the idea of starting each discussion with a summary of a section of the book. The
summarizing began on 04/13/04, when we reached the clinical part of the book.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 37/118
What you find below is a uncensured, uncorrected collection of the summaries. They’re meant for discussion,
not for teaching purposes per se, but we are allowing them to become part of this website simply because we
hope they might be useful to other beginners. People from 7 countries did parts of it: Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and the USA. (More countries participated in the discussion:
Germany , Israel, Sweden, …) It was fun to participate, and very inspiring, … but sometimes hard too: we chose
a fixed schedule of weekly reading, discussing, and sometimes summarizing … but we were willing and
committed.
Part of the value in doing this probably cannot be achieved just by reading these products. This way we
structured it beginners, hesitatant to take part in discussions between more experienced ACT -ors, had unique
learning opportunities by taking part in the beginners’  discussion. The “masters” could watch us and interfered
when helpful, which also was stimulating. I can recommend the formula to other beginners and hesitating
“lurkers”. It might be worth while to start a second round. But that’ s up to others. Meanwhile, here are our
written products.
Thanks to all beginners who participated, and to the listserve for the opportunity!

Contributed by Kate Partridge  Creative Hopelessness: Challenging the Normal Change Agenda [Comments in
square brackets are from me. I know this summary is almost as long as the section itself, but doing it has really
helped me understand it. Kate] Theoretical Focus Resistance to Change: Clients enter therapy because they have
already struggled for a long time with ""the problem"", in many dif ferent ways (contemplation, planning,
discussion, praying, reading, tapes, etc.) In spite of so much ef fort having been exerted, no solution to the
problem has arisen. In this sense, the client is resistant to change. There are [at least] two reasons for this: 1) The
client has not found the right way to fix the problem. 2) There is a fundamental flaw in the model for change,
which is based on culturally sanctioned, language-based rules for solving problems. Culturally Sanctioned
[Unconscious] Problem-Solving Rules:
Psychological problems = the presence of unpleasant inner experiences (feelings, thoughts, sensations,
etc.). The presence of these unpleasant experiences signal that ""something is wrong and must be changed"".
""Healthy living"" = the absence of these negative experiences.
These experiences need to be eliminated by the correction of inner deficits (e.g., lack of confidence),
through the understanding or modification of their causes (e.g., overcritical parents).
The underlying metaconcept is: ""The problem is one of bad content; change the content and the problem will go
away ."" ACT  Assumption [Message of Hope and Liberation]: The Change Agenda Is Not Workable: The
culturally sanctioned problem solving rules are like water to fish - they are taken so much for granted that to
challenge them seems nonsensical. The ACT  therapist works to undermine the sense of normality surrounding
these rules, by showing that ef forts based on these rules can actually be the source of problems, not their
solution. The therapist asks: • ""Which will you believe, your 'mind' or your actual experience of the
unworkability of these rules?"" [Not expressed in these words, naturally .] The therapist takes apart for the client
the underlying logical assumption: 1) Identify the problem: ""bad"" thoughts and feelings. 2) Eliminate the
problem: "" "" "" "" 3) Life will then improve. By drawing out multiple examples from the client's own history , the
client can become experientially connected to what is often a long series of unsuccessful attempts to use this
strategy . This can be quite painful. The therapist aims to or ganize most of the client's solutions into a general
class of events that can be described as: ""Control of private experience = Successful living."" The client is
(gently) encouraged to confront the reality of their multiple experiences of the unworkability of this assumption.
This leaves the client often not knowing what to do next, in a state of ""creative hopelessness"". The state is
""creative"" because entirely new strategies can be developed with being overwhelmed by the old and previously
unconscious rule system. Clinical Focus In this phase of ACT , the therapist focuses on the following issues:
Client has tried everything, but the problem remains.
The problem is not one of motivation, nor of specific tactics. The client is not to blame for being stuck.
There is a paradox here: Working hard to solve the problem makes the problem seem worse. The solution
is part of the problem. [I need some concrete examples here of how the solution makes things worse -
KAP]
The logic of the problem-solving system is flawed. A more valid and reliable source of problem-solving is
the client's own direct experience and their feedback from life.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

TABLE 4.1: ACT  Goals, Strategies, and Interventions Regarding Creative Hopelessness. [There is no point in
summarizing this useful table. It is on Page 91]. Informed Consent ACT  interventions can be intense, and the
client must be prepared for this by being provided with:
general descriptions of operating principles [How general?]
frank discussion of areas of ambiguity [What does this mean?]
alternative forms of therapy that could be followed instead of ACT
Treatment involves the client in having to face previously avoided experiences. When this occurs, the client can
start to question his/her commitment to treatment. Therefore, the client should be committed to meeting for a
certain number of sessions, to expect ups and downs, and to hang in until a progress review occurs at a specified
session. In this way , the client is guided away from impulsively dropping out of treatment.

Drawing out the system-developing the idea with the client that the process of trying to solve the problem-
verbalized as actions taken by the mind or as ""language"", creates a logical trap that if directly described presents
its own paradox of being linear , literal and analytical-the very process we are attempting to discredit. A less
direct approach: What do you want? Outcome goals: Love others, have children, be content...Process goals: A
technique (I think) that leads to outcomes. Example-Outcome goal: living well, Process goal: changing bad
feelings. Linking these two by a technique such as drinking is an unworkable system. I'm confused about this.
""Process"" seems dynamic while ""Outcome"" seems static. Aren't ""drinking"" and ""changing bad feelings"" both
processes? In other words, isn't ""changing bad feelings"" a strategy while drinking is a tactic (subset)? Anyway
then-What has the client tried? This is where you identify with the client and follow along with his historic plan
of solving his problems, clarifying with examples the process of attempts, and agreeing on their relative success
of lack thereof(there should be lack thereof or the person wouldn't be here, right?). How has it worked? Using
the ""mind"" metaphor to reify the process of producing inflexible and unworkable verbal rules that persist as
technique in spite of experiential feedback that they aren't working. Also pointing out the false solution of
""trying harder"" when confronted with this reality . This (1) focuses on verbal understanding and (2) helps client
look at mental reactions rather than through them. The essence of this section is creating the dichotomy of what
your mind tells you versus what experience is telling you.

Confr onting the System: Cr eative Hopelessness  (this is a little long, but wanted to make sure I covered
everthing adequately)
Begins by noting that engendering creative hopelessness is the first ACT  intervention (following thorough
assessment of the client's 'presenting problem', change agenda, and strategies that have been tried to
resolve it.
Also notes (or warns) that doing this inevitably involves the use of human language, which is part of the
trap the client is in anyway - the conundrum of attempting to side- step the trap of language, but needing to
use language to deliver interventions. The therapist is thus just as susceptible as the client to the trap of
literal language, and must be careful about too strongly believing or becoming fixed on the logic of words.
This highlights the equality of therapist and client, with the therapist's only advantage that of having an
outside perspective (the client would also have this advantage were the therapist's problems the topic of
discussion).
The therapist confronts the system by working outside it, using language only to meet certain ends, not to
change beliefs or model more ""rational"" beliefs and thoughts. If those ends are not met, then the words are2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 40/118
not true, no matter how logical. So this takes us from the typical reliance on logic to relying on workability
- this become our metric. The question for both clients and therapists is ""does that work for you?"".
Workability and Cr eative Hopelessness
In the beginning of this section, the authors provide a caveat that it is written with severely af fected clients
in mind (although the tools are still useful in less severe circumstances).
The work starts with confrontation, although of a dif ferent sort than typically thought. The confrontation is
between the client's change agenda and the client's experience of the workability of that system. The
message of the therapist and client being in the same boat as far as confronting this system (i.e. the
therapist is not some expert who has all the answers) can be powerfully conveyed by the therapist sitting
next to the client, with the system imagined as out in front, being confronted by both people together .
The therapist is armed at this point with information related to strategies the client has tried in the past that
haven't worked.
Unworkability is gently suggested - the therapist highlights how hard the client has been thinking and
working at the change agenda, and that consulting a therapist is another attempt to find a solution. Another
powerful intervention here is to highlight that usually when we work this hard, things get accomplished,
but that this situation seems dif ferent. All this ef fort has not resolved the issue.(this is a subtle way to
highlight the role of the client's experience)
This moves into a discussion of the notion that perhaps looking for solutions is part of the problem. That
the client is stuck, and it's not because they are not clever enough to figure it out or are not trying. Perhaps
it is because it can't work. The authors suggest that a way to make this more tangible to the client is to
suggest that the client doesn't actually believe there is a solution - that anything of fered by the therapist
would likely just be refuted by the client based on the client' s experience that it would not work. So here,
the idea that experience and mind tell the client dif ferent things, and that experience is more accurate is
brought to the discussion.
The authors break from the therapeutic dialogue here to discuss the importance of framing creative
hopelessness as a positive thing. Being careful not to suggest that the client is hopeless or to engender
hopeless feelings. But rather to introduce this idea as a starting point for giving up unworkable strategies
and opening up for new possibilities to emer ge.
Several metaphors are provided, including the Man in the Hole metaphor , p. 101, to side-step the trap of
language. This metaphor is flexible and can be used to address many issues a client might raise, such as:
giving up
belief in the need to delve into the past
responsibility
blame
continuing to look for solutions - this one actually seems really important and I think best highlights
the goals of this part of therapy . The therapist really seems to stay away from promising solutions,
but takes on a role of saying ""I don't know"". The goal at this point is batter down the tendency
toward sense-making and to stay with the importance of the client giving up unworkable strategies,
even without any promise of what will come next. This is a leap of faith and should be noted as
such, since clients (like the rest of us) are definitely not used to not trying to make sense of things
when there are problems in our lives.
illustrating the opportunity suf fering presents for us to learn to disentangle ourselves from our own
minds.
The goal of this dialogue and the highlighting of what experience tells us, then, is to break apart the
control-private-events-to-control-life-quality believe system. It is also to make contact with the client's
knowledge of how the world works (rather than systems of logical language and rules that govern
behavior). The authors highlight the importance of being mindful of this goal through this discussion.

Chinese Handcuf fs Metaphor illustrates that sometimes the counterintuitive solution is the one that works. Brief;
can be used to reinforce the message of the more extended Man in the Hole metaphor or to introduce the therapy
as part of an informed consent procedure. Understanding: Belief versus Experiential Wisdom  Expressions of
belief or disbelief on the part of the client are irrelevant and probably signify that the old control agenda is trying
to claim any new territory opened up by metaphorical talk. The dimension of belief and disbelief is toward the
nonexperiencing, derived stimulus functions end of the experiencing-nonexperiencing continuum. This includes
the therapist's beliefs as well as the client's. Persuasion is not an ACT  move; consulting one's experience is.
Confusing No Hope with Cr eative Hopelessness  2 possible errors: confusing creative hopelessness with
hopelessness as a negative feeling state or with hopelessness as a belief. Creative hopelessness is an action or a
behavioral posture that results from experiencing the uselessness of deliberate control over unwanted thoughts
and feelings, because this control cannot deliver the promised rewards. The over expansive track that maintains
the control agenda is undermined. This prepares the way for a fundamentally new approach. However , talking
about hopelessness is a sign of persuasion ef forts on the part of the therapist. Hopelessness the feeling is often
used as a move to coerce someone (God, a spouse, the therapist, oneself) to rescue the client from despair .
Hopelessness the belief tends to be over expansive, in the sense that the person sees him or her self or life or
situation as hopeless, rather than the more circumscribed control agenda. Barriers to Giving Up the
Unworkable System  It can be hard for clients to give up unworkable control strategies because previously
avoided material quickly shows up in consciousness and there's no clear alternative. Metaphors that can be
useful here include: Feedback Screech Metaphor , which illustrates how control moves amplify the inherent
discomfort in living and make ""tiptoeing around the stage"" seem like a good solution; and Sports and Activities
Metaphors, in which practice makes better , you have to ""step up to the plate"" or ""get in the water ,"" and
overthinking interferes with the process. Letting Go of the Struggle as an Alternative  Tug of War with a
Monster Metaphor illustrates that letting go of the struggle with unwanted private experiences can be a more
workable strategy than trying to win the struggle. Clients may want to know how to ""let go of the rope"" and
describing the process would be a bit like describing how to swim or hit a baseball or drive a car: better learned
by experience.

The chapter on creative hopelessness ends with a few therapeutic do's and dont's. I took the freedom to add some
do's and don'ts from the list and one of my own 1. Am I hurting or helping the client seems to be a question that's
often asked in workshops. Kelly Wilson suggests on this list (April 15th) that this is about the therapists' own
experiential avoidance when sitting with the patients' pain. Empirical findings show that you don't have to be
afraid that your patients will quit therapy , get deeply depressed or even kill themselves when they discover the
futility of their struggle. In other words the message is essentially a hopeful one, and patients may feel relieved.
CR may be the first step towards an increase of degrees of freedom of the patients' respondent behavior . 2. I
suggest that as a therapist you have to face your own creative hopelessness in order to be able to sit with the
patient when he or she is testing his rule sytem against experience. 3. Don't expect anything to change (yet),
because any change can be linked to the intentional change agenda, and so become just another avoidance
strategy . This is paradoxical. As I try to grasp it right now , experiential avoidance seems to be an escape reaction
triggered (or conditioned) by a certain class of stimuli (Sd, like for instance the possibility of being criticized),
and thus it's under antecedent control (see also Kelly Wilson's note on this). Each time I face this type of
situation I feel stressed or aroused (CER), want to escape or avoid by procrastination, let's say (CAR). This is
reinforced by nicely elaborated verbal rules (COV)(and each time I think I'm right is a reinforcement, a +S+).
Moreover , i feel relieved in the short run because the criticism is avoided (-S-). If I try to change this chain of
behavior without loosening the conditioned response, I may just get entangled in a more complex conditioned
avoidance response. In terms of 'Mary had a little .... ' I will get even more 'lamb' connections on the dots. I
guess the idea is that behavior change will result spontaneously when the link between the situation and your
avoidance reactions will be weakened, for instance by an increase of awareness of the unworkability . And isn't
hope just the same as finding more and new opportunities to achieve your goals? Just like the two Swedish
colleagues I 'd like to try to describe these processes in behavior analytic terms, but feel very insecure about it. It
seems to me very helpful in the process of understanding ACT , and also in grasping the patient's struggle. So2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

who wants to join or help in this enterprise? 4. Give homework to help people become aware of how they
struggle, and what situations trigger it. Just do self monitoring, and not behavior change (see above) 5. The book
(and the discussion on the list as well) seems to suggest that there should be a fixed order in therapy with CH as
the starting point. I'd like to cite Kelly Wilson (April 15th) on this: "" No you absolutely don't need to do CH like
it says in the book. If it needs to be done, you will end up doing it. why? Well as you pursue values, it will
appear as an obstacle--then you will do defusion of hopelessness, and the emer gence of what we like to call
creative hopelessness."" 6. A very important do was formulated yesterday by Joanne Steinwachs. I'll just cite her
contribution, can't do it better , as she's also including a beautiful metaphor . ""I find it useful to begin the
questioning with 'beginner's mind'. Perhaps what they tried did work out, in some way for them. Of course, if
they're stuck in a framework of unworkable rules, then in the lar ger picture, it doesn't work, but sometimes
talking to people about what they do and how it works in their idiosyncratic rule system illuminates the rule
system both for them and for me. If I start with the agenda of discovering unworkability , then I can miss a lot of
the nuances of trappedness, both for them and for me, and I feel like I move into a place of expert rather than co-
explorer . I also feel that using ""discovering unworkability"" as my guide, respect and curiosity are harder to
maintain as my base feelings towards the client. I can't do this if I've got the agenda of discovering
unworkability . I have to hold the idea that the system DOES work for the client as a possibility . Usually , in my
experience, clients have worked hard and creatively , their shtick does work in some way and it's often an elegant
and creative adaptation to some crazy rule. I talk to people about the pre-Copernican world, and how
astronomers were trying to describe the path of the planets, starting from the wrong assumption that the earth
was the center of the universe. They came up with elegant and complex theories that sometimes could predict the
position of the planet. Men spent their entire lives on these theories. To let them go took enormous courage and
great pain. That conversation comes after I and the client understand the complex rules that govern their
""planetary movement"" and we've paid tribute to the fact that the rules can in some ways predict and control their
experiences."" Perhaps techniques as interviewing for solutions (De Shazer) can be useful here. Progress to the
next phase can be seen when clients express doubts about their system of coping and avoidance. Personal work
for the clinician is building on the work on page 80. Somehow this questioning is a bit too abstract for me-as-a-
client. Me-as-a-client needs a bit more encouragement and support as to what is a problem, how can I analyze it
in ACT  terms, what level of detail is required to gain awareness or insight. I like to be as concrete and detailed as
possible, and I try to find out what exactly is is what a client did (does), thought (thinks) and felt (feels) when
using his or her strategies. Underneath abstract descriptions of an apparent intelligent strategy can hide a
completely invalid schema (can I use such a term here?).

Contr ol Is the Pr oblem  In ACT , attempts at controlling private events are thought of as part of the system that
have brought the client into therapy . Four factors are identified that most clients bring into therapy (and, that
have been wrestled with at various times in this forum):
1. ""Deliberate control works well for me in the external world.""
2. ""I was taught it should work with personal experiences (e.g., 'Don't be afraid...').""
3. ""It seems to work for other people around me (e.g., 'Daddy never seemed scared...').""
4. ""It even appears to work with certain experiences I've struggled with (e.g., relaxation works for a while to
reduce my anxiety symptoms)."" It is emphasized that the examination of control strategies is based
entirely on the clients experience, with workability as the unit of analysis, and that the therapist needs to
be extremely careful not to dictate or demand that the client evaluate their control strategies as
unworkable. Therapist techniques that are mentioned include using metaphors and experiential exercises
to help the client develop increasing sensitivity to directly experienced contingencies. Also, the authors
mention that asking questions rather than stating conclusions can be helpful in reducing pliance on the part
of the client.

Giving the struggle a name - contr ol is the pr oblem  Continuing to explore unworkable strategies (i.e.,
""digging"" in the man in the hole metaphor) without interpretation. The goal here is to explore the form and
function (immediate goals) of client's behaviors and hold these up against the change agenda. At this point in
time there is no need to do any more than just touch and clarify these behaviors and their functions. Eventually
the goal is to lump these responses into a single class ""emotional control"" The rule of private events  The key
lesson here is that purposeful control works in the successful manipulation of external events but that the same
strategies do not work in controlling private events as these are governed by historical and automatic factors. The
rule ""if bad events are removed, then bad outcomes can be avoided"" is not ef fective with regards to private
events. On pages 120-122 is a good transcript showing a therapist bringing out the paradox of control:
If I'm not willing to have it (e.g., anxiety), I have it
If I don't get so uptight about being anxious, I will be less anxious
If I am willing to have it in order to get rid of it, I am not willing to have it and I will have it again
Polygraph metaphor  (page 123) is a cor e intervention in this stage of therapy - particularly useful for
anxiety or  mood disorder ed clients.  In short the metaphor describes being hooked up to the most sensitive and
accurate lie detector ever built. The task is simple, ST AY RELAXED. An extra incentive is given, ""stay relaxed
or I’ll shoot you"". Not surprisingly , any hint of anxiety would escalate (""Oh my god, I’m getting anxious."") and
BAM!, it’ s all over . There are three elements that can be drawn from this metaphor:
1. contrast between controllable behaviors (i.e., paint the wall or I will shoot you) versus behavior that is not
regulated successfully by verbal rules (relax or I'll shoot you)
2. People carry their own polygraph with them all the time (their nervous system) and their own gun (self-
esteem, self-worth). They are constantly monitoring for symptoms (e.g., anxiety) and firing the gun at
themselves
3. How seemingly successful attempts to make situation work, don't work in the long term. For example,
taking valium may help you relax initially but what about when it wears of f?
Chocolate cake exer cise (124) - particularly effective with clients struggling with obsessive thoughts or
ruminations  In short, don't think about delicious warm chocolate cake with icing and cream! (yum) Two things
here:
1. either it is particularly dif ficult not to think about it (me included in this group)
2. or attempts to not think about it (e.g., ""I thought about something else"") actually require you to think about
chocolate cake (you have to know what you are not thinking about)
Similar idea can be applied to physical reactions (e.g., salivation) ""The key lesson here is for the client to make
direct contact with the inef fectiveness of conscious purposeful control in these domains"" (my own personal
comments: I really like these ideas, and regularly use similar concepts no matter what therapeutic style I am
incorporating. I think a lot of these ideas have filtered into the CBT  framework, whereby automatic thoughts are
treated more as uncontrollable private events and B (behavior change) is emphasized. The only trouble I have
with some of this stuf f is picking those clients that respond well to discussing these kinds of issues. This is
totally my personal opinion, but I think many therapies suf fer from some kind of intellectual bias, that is,
techniques developed by well-educated, trained minds. I have trouble breaking down psych concepts to layman
concepts. This is not a big issue at this stage, because the use of metaphors breaks down that barrier , but when it
comes later to exploring the traps of language, I think this is so.

How Emotional Contr ol Is Learned  At this point in therapy , the client is coming to the realization that ""control
doesn't work"". In the recovery business this is the same as ""taking"" the first step (12 step approach) where the
client comes to the realization that they are ""powerless."" This can be a frightening step. As the book points out,
the ""thought that repeatedly applying a seemingly unworkable strategy proves there is something wrong with the
client 'deep down inside.'"" and this can be quite troubling. Again, in recovery we would say , that this is like
""doing the same thing and expecting a dif ferent result."" It is like the guy that thought he had figured out how to
fly with a wing like contraption attached to his arms. He got up on his roof and ran straight of f the end and
flapped his arms like crazy . But, as you would expect, he landed with a thud and broke several bones in his body .
After healing he thought, well I don't think I jumped high enough, or flapped my arms fast enough. That's what I
have to do, jump higher and flap faster . I don't think I need to tell you what happened. Getting back to my
assignment, at this point it would be easy for the client to blame them self for the predicament that they have
gotten themselves into, however , as the book points out, all of the conditioning that got them here is actually
very random. The trick now is how do we ""come to believe""(step 2) this. The book suggests, ""Experiential
exercises are particularly useful for demonstrating how easy it is to condition a irrelevant and nonfunctional
private response."" The ""'What Are The Numbers?"" exercise is a good intervention at this point. In this exercise
the book demonstrates the arbitrariness of reactions, thus hopefully helping the client see that """"I'm bad"" is no
more meaningful than ""one, two, three."""" The therapist would than help the client move into examining the
apparent success of a control agenda. Which brings us to, Examine The Appar ent Success Of Contr ol At this
point it is suggested that we help the client explore the ""cost of using this change agenda in the wrong places.""
The therapist is helping the client ""establish discrimination."" Which always makes me think of the serenity
prayer , God grant me the ser enity to accept the thing I can not change (or  contr ol), the courage (or
willingness) to change (or  contr ol) the things I can, and the wisdom to know the differ ence (""establish
discrimination"").  I see this step as helping the client become more aware of when this control (change) agenda
works and when it doesn't. The book gives a good dialogue of walking a client through this process. But as the
client begins to get a sense of the unworkability of this control agenda, they can feel naked and vulnerable to the
world, and desperately looking for someway to cover up. At this point all we want to do is help the client
recognize what thoughts and feelings are showing up. This is not an easy task. The therapist needs to continually
undermine the clients need to avoid the distressing thoughts and feelings and to help the client become more
""willing"" to experience these things in the here and now . All of this leads the client to ""the alternative to control:
willingness"" which is next weeks homework. However , it brings me back to the serenity prayer , and how I see
willingness (or courage), ""to change the things that I can.""

The Alternative to Contr ol and the Two Scales Metaphor  The objective here is to point to an alternative to
the control agenda. Use willingness instead of acceptance-because it is often confused with resignation or
tolerance/defeat. Two Scales Metaphor
designed to look at concept of control and its relationship to distress
Should be linked to clients' experience of their own futile ef fort to control distress, can link it to more
mundane or less meaningful examples for the client (for example, trying to sleep during a bout of
insomnia. The harder you try to fall asleep the less sleep you get. In supervision, we often use the Chinese
finger trap example-the harder you try to get out of it, the less out of it you are- you get stuck.)
Want to undermine the client's confidence in the control strategy and depathologize the struggle over
control
Not crazy , just using the wrong strategy
Metaphor  Two scales--anxiety (or whatever fits for the client here) and willingness. Willingness has been low ,
anxiety has been high. Client came in with the goal of getting anxiety to be low . But what if there's this other
scale that we haven't been using, haven't even seen, called willingness. Make a promise about what will happen
if willingness is set high-anxiety will be low except when it is high and then it will be high. If you move
willingness up, then anxiety is free to move around. Seems like the goal here is not describing acceptance or2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 45/118
distinguishing acceptance/resignation, but merely providing an alternative to their endless, futile struggle Can
distinguish between mind/experience here. Mind tells you that if you demand anxiety to go down, then it will.
However , experience says that this doesn't work ""Suppose life is giving you this choice: You can choose to try to
control what you feel and lose control over your life, or let go of control over discomfort and get control over
your life"" (p.135) Willingness is one thing that only you have control over . I can influence you feeling anxiety
for example, but I cannot control how willing you are to have that anxiety . Comment : This was a perfect reading
for me this week! I recently used ACT  in my abnormal psychology class in the service of changing the stigma of
the mentally ill and making a dif ference in my students' lives. I provided an alternative to their control agenda,
but I spent a lot of time distinguishing between acceptance and resignation. I had one student in particular who
would not ""accept"" the thing he hated most about himself (which was what I used in exposure and defusion
exercises) because he refused to ""just get over it and move on"". I like using willingness instead of acceptance
because it frames the whole concept in a dif ferent way . There's no question about what willingness is, acceptance
can have dif ferent connotations. Another  thing : When first reading this section, I thought ""how can you
describe willingness"", ""willingness to what...?"" I think that my class would have benefited from my using the
willingness to experience as opposed to acceptance. This seems much clearer to me.

Chapter 5 finishes with:
1. personal work for the clinician
2. a clinical vignette
3. appendices containing daily experiences diary , identifying programming exercise, feeling good exercise,
rules of the game exercise and clean versus dirty discomfort diary . I'll deal with each of these in turn:
Personal work for  the clinician  Having identified a problem in your own life, explore the strategies that you
have used or are currently using to solve this problem a) consider each strategy and designate it as either an2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 46/118
acceptance or control strategy b) examine the distribution of control and acceptance strategies. Is there a trend?
c) For each control strategy , identify what it was that you hoped (hope) to control, avoid, manipulate, change or
eliminate Clinical Vignette  The clinical vignette describes a 45yo male with severe anxiety attacks at work and
more recently at home. There is stress at work (high stress job), a recent move and relationship dif ficulties. The
client uses deep breathing, distraction, hypervigilance to physical symptoms, avoidance of work and
tranquilizers to cope with the anxiety . The question(s) for clinicians are: a) how would you conceptualize the
client's major coping strategies and assumed goals? b) How would you discuss these solutions with the client? c)
What would your goal(s) be in doing so The answers are as follows: a) strategies are primarily to reduce or
control anxiety and appear not to work (long term) b) is anxiety serving another function? Are there areas in your
life that you legitimately have reason to be anxious about c) Goal is to separate clean versus dirty anxiety
(legitimate stressors versus the struggle, fusion) Appendices  Daily experiences diary  Client records
uncomfortable moments, including feelings, thoughts and bodily sensations as well as ef forts to handle these
things Client and therapist can explore the use of acceptance versus control strategies. Therapist can reinforce
strategies that reflect acceptance. Willingness diary  Client provides a global rating for each day (e.g., emotion
rating from 1-10). Client records the amount of ef fort put in to getting this to go away (rating 1-10) Client
records how workable the day was (rating 1-10) Client and therapist explore the relationships between the
struggle to controland the workability of the day . Identifying pr ogramming exer cise Clients are encouraged to
explore how a significant childhood event (or events) shaped or programmed who they are now to demonstrate
how dysfunctional coping strategies are passed on. This is to demonstrate the arbitrary nature of learning events.
Feeling good exer cise Clients fill out a questionnaire tapping into a number of specific language rules that act as
self-instructions (e.g., ""the way to be healthy is to learn better and better ways to control and eliminate negative
emotions"") Rules of the game exer cise Clients are asked to generate their favorite life sayings (e.g., no pain, no
gain). Client and therapist can then explore sayings with reference to acceptance versus control strategies or on
the basis of a number of other dimensions (e.g., black/white thinking, severity of consequence, good versus bad)
Clean versus Dirty discomfort diary  Client is encouraged to explore particular ""high risk"" situations in terms
of clean discomfort (what immediately showed up in the way of thoughts, feelings etc) versus dirty discomfort
(what emer ged as a result of the struggle with these initial feelings)

Building Acceptance by Defusing Language
Here are some nuts and bolts followed by questions and critiques:
1. The distinction between process and content: language is a learned set of derived stimulus relations, while
languaging is the action of deriving those relations.
2. Humans (therapists, clients, etc.) often don't make this distinction and often relate on (and become connected
to) the content level. Taking these contents at ""face value"" (i.e., literally , tangibly) in turn, leads to powerful and
predictable behavior patterns (that are often destructive) on the part of the client.
3. One of the main paradoxes in ACT  is that language cannot be weakened by more language; however the
essence of deliteralization is to take advantage of loopholes in the way language functions (by teaching the client
to see that thoughts and feelings are just that-thoughts and feelings).
4. Page 152 contains a table (6.1) of ACT  goals, strategies, and interventions to use regarding deliteralization.
5. One of the ways to begin addressing the paradox and function of language is to demonstrate to the client the
limits of language in deciphering human experience (and to elicit their own examples). For example, there are
two metaphors (found on page 153) that communicate how describing something is dif ferent from experiencing
it. One metaphor is ""finding a place to sit,"" which essentially describes how talking about a chair (its features,2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 47/118
uses) does not help when one wants to actually sit down. In other words, one cannot ""sit"" in a description of a
chair . One can only sit IN an actual chair . A corollary of this metaphor is that one can describe the experience of
swimming (how the water feels moving through it, its temperature, etc.). However , one cannot learn to swim in
or by a description.
6. There is an assumption in ACT  that ""your mind is not your friend."" Extrapolating from pre-human experience,
one can see that the (human) mind was not developed to make humans or ""prehumans"" feel good. It was
developed to keep humans from danger and was mostly comprised of negative content. Explain to clients the
paradox ""your mind is not your friend AND you cannot live without it.""
7. Another assumption is that language is arbitrary and that once it is learned, it becomes relatively independent
of immediate environmental support. This reminds me of my nanny's (successful) ef forts to train my 20 month-
old son to say ""bling-bling"" when he sees jewelry-now without her having to label it.
8. There is a provocative quote related to the usefulness of nonverbal (experiential?) knowledge at the end of this
section on page 154: ""If we suddenly had all nonverbal knowledge removed from our repertoires-we would fall
to the floor quite helpless.""
Comments/questions:
9. It has been my experience that, while clients appear ""fused"" to a lot of dif ferent ideas/contents, a great share of
them come to my of fice without having specific terms/language to describe their experience. In fact they come
ONL Y with experience, which they have a dif ficult time describing in words. For example, an extremely anxious
patient I had (with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) wouldn't ever label himself as ""anxious,"" rather he just knows
he feels bad.
10. I don't know if behavior patterns follow from the premise that one does not make a distinction between the
process of thinking and actual thought, and becomes fused with actual thought content, thereby leading directly
to ingrained behavior patterns. I suppose one could explain this as troublesome behavior patterns becoming
automatic due to conditioning (i.e., not being aware of the interaction pattern itself); however , I'm not sure if this
is because one is fused to a verbal event.
11. Have any of these hypotheses been evaluated using individuals with various types of brain injuries (resulting
in apraxia, aphasia, acquired deficits in language versus acquired deficits in motor ability , etc.)?

Deliteralizing Language  Several exercises are described to help people improve their skill of looking at the
process of language instead of looking from language.
Thoughts are used to structure our perception of the world. We don't even notice that we look at the world
from our thoughts, because we believe them in literal way . To look at the process of language involves
focusing attention on language as language, cryptic as this may sound. A bit of defusion from literal
'understanding' can be achieved by watching the direct stimulus functions of language like sound, the
feeling of your muscles, the sight, etc.
An elegant way to watch your attention switch from the symbolic function of a word to some of its direct
stimulus functions is by repeating a word over and over again for one or two minutes. This is the classic
milk, milk, milk exercise (T itchener , 1916). Present it as an experiment or experiential exercise and help
the client notice how the literal meaning of the word disappears and one can see the word as an instant of
the language process.
I like the notion of skill learning here. Deliteralization is a skill you can practice, it's not another rule to
follow . One can play with direct stimulus properties and thereby loosen the 'grand illusion of language' by2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 48/118
realizing that the symbolized thing is not there at all. The only thing that's there is sound, movement,
breathing and so on. And this is not a fact, but a skill, something you do.
Another skill that helps to defuse from nasty or frightening thoughts is practiced in the passengers on the bus
exercise. In this exercise the relation between a person and his or her thoughts (or avoided inner experiences) is
reframed. These are the elements of the metaphor:
1. You, the driver of the bus. You want to go places and do your job.
2. The passengers are your thoughts and all kinds of inner states. Some are nice, some ugly , scary , nasty .
3. The scary ones threat you and want to come up front where you'll see them.
4. You take this very serious and stop the bus (you don't go anywhere anymore) and try to make a deal with
them: they'll keep quiet in the back of the bus, only when you do exactly what they tell you.
5. This means your route plan is greatly impaired and you're always on the watch inside the bus.
6. What happens is that you let these passengers control the whereabouts of the bus. You, the driver , are not
in control at all.
7. Even though these passengers look scary , nasty , threatening etc. they can't take control (unless you let
them). They can't make you do something against your will.

Summary : We are in Chapter 6, Building Acceptance by Defusing Language. Page 158 begins the section titled
""Don't Buy Thoughts"". The subject is the deliterization of language. The explanations, exercises and metaphors
are designed to enable the client to become aware of and ""assume"" self as perspective and to focus that
perspective on thoughts and feelings themselves as they are experienced. Comment: The ease or dif ficulty of this
and degree of success may vary greatly from person to person, but those who find it most dif ficult may also reap
the greatest benefits. The shift to looking at literal meaning from looking through literal meaning is subtle.
""Having a thought"" may be distinguished from ""buying a thought"" or ""buying in"". A common example is the
shift from ""I am a bad person"" to ""I am having the thought that I am a bad person"". The idea is to expose the
process of thinking often hidden behind the content of thinking. Mindfulness exercises include Zen-like
meditation, Soldiers in the Parade Exercise, Leaves in the Stream Exercise, Contents on the Card Exercise, and
Taking Your Mind for a Walk Exercise. The client/therapist dialogue (pgs. 159-161) illustrates a therapy situation
using the Soldiers in the Parade. Note how you have to get the client to try this and then give you feedback as to
what they are experiencing. The client is specifically reminded that thoughts like ""This isn't working"" or ""I can't
do this"" should be placed on the soldiers' placards (along with ""This therapist must be one of those nutty Gestalt
guys I've heard about.""). The therapist sort of anthropomorphizes the mind and speaks of it trying to ""hook"" the
client on literal meaning. He also points out how the parade stops when the client ""buys"" or is ""hooked"" by a
thought. I additionally had the thought in this section that while ""Contents on Cards"" and ""T aking Your Mind for
A Walk"" may seem gamey or contrived, these might be necessary and ef fective with certain clients who
experience very emotional fusions such as cluster B type folks(or the more politically correct ""multi problem
client""). Undermining Reasons as Causes  A troublesome class of thoughts, reasons tend to disguise themselves
as deterministic statements with a cause-ef fect function which they really may not have. Reasons often actually
function as language community justifications. Personal history is often cited as a reason things can't change.
This has always been a real pain for psychodynamic therapists (I speak from personal experience). Statements
focusing on functional utility rather than literal truth are suggested as helpers, such as, ""And what is this story in
the service of""(Ouch! They may get angry!), ""If God told you that your explanation is 100% correct, how would
this help you?"", etc. Another dialogue (pgs. 164-166) illustrates how reasons may be deliteralized to the clients'
advantage without loosing their true function. An additional ""tips"" section is Disrupting Troublesome Language
Practices (pgs. 166-168). A discussion of the etymology of the word ""but"", for example, reveals how it can be a
psychologically limiting verbal behavior that may be changed to ""and"". ""I want to go, but I am angry"" could be
""I want to go and I am angry"" leading to behavior which may not be controlled by the language
conceptualization of it. The ""And/Be Out Convention"" inset describes how this might be communicated to a
client. I had the thought that this requires some careful listening to insert this timely intervention when it can be2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 49/118
most useful to the client. I will only comment that this is an extremely important section, drawn from RFT
research and Zen and Gestalt traditions which are nuclear to ACT . It strikes me as needing a great deal of
experience and/or training to be handy with it. I suspect that psychodynamically trained therapists, such as
myself, have a harder time with it because we have to unlearn and learn at the same time.

Evaluation versus Description  Evaluations masquerade as descriptions of things and events because language
makes little distinction between them. Descriptions may be thought of as primary properties of things and events
while evaluations are secondary properties, reactions to things and events. The authors point out that most clients
bring negative self-referential evaluative self-talk directed toward themselves (""I'm a despicable human being"")
to therapy that would be dif ficult to accept if it described the essence of a person. The Bad Cup Metaphor
illustrates this principle by pointing out the dif ference between essential properties of a cup (such as that it is
made of metal or ceramic or whatever) and our evaluations of the cup (good cup/bad cup). As an aside, my
husband, who is not a therapist, really related to the question of ""If all the humans on earth died tomorrow ,
would this still be a good (or just, or moral, etc.) ____?"" as a way of identifying evaluations. A second strategy
for highlighting the kind of thought or speech someone is engaged in is to have them label each thought or
sentence as a description, an evaluation, a feeling, a thought, a physical sensation, a memory , etc (Cubby
Holing). Although this is awkward, it can be very ef fective at promoting defusion with private events.
Willingness: The Goal of Deliteralization  The goal of deliteralization is to decrease the role of evaluation and
strengthen the client's ability to take a non-judgmental, observer perspective so that they can begin to observe
their own disturbing private events with less struggle and more willingness. Two exercises that give the client
live experience with willingness are the Physicalizing Exercise and the Tin Can Monster Exercise. The
Physicalizing Exercise has the client treat their unwanted content (depression, anxiety , addiction, etc) as an
object, by describing its physical attributes (size, weight, color , density , etc). Then the client sets it aside and
describes reactions to the ""object"" they described; they repeat the exercise with the reaction. They then go back
and look at the first ""object""; often it is less intense in some attributes (smaller , lighter , etc). The Tin Can
Monster Exercise helps the client get in touch with their ""observer you,"" then uses that perspective to explore
several domains (physical sensations, thoughts, feelings, memories) associated with the problem area. The focus
is on staying with the uncomfortable, unwanted content while letting go of the struggle to make it go away .

Therapeutic do's and don'ts  The goal of deliteralization is a hefty one. Chapter Six of fers a dazzling array of
ACT  metaphors and exercises: confronting nasty passengers on the bus, endlessly saying milk, milk, milk,
soldiers wandering around in a parade amongst the recesses of the mind, taking your mind for a walk, reasons as
causes, avoid use of those 'buts,"" and practicing awareness of your experience, to name just a few .
Deliteralization is an essential step in the ACT  process, and yet its filled with perilous pitfalls for our heroic ACT
therapist. First, there is the challenging task of entering the client's language system The therapist seeks to realize
that it is a language system, while at the same time avoid the many opportunities presented to ""fuse"" with the
system. This challenge occurs because we are using language to point out the dangers of language in an ef fort to
convince a person to avoid being taken in by the power of their own words. Encouraging willingness and
deliteralization by using words alone may result in an overuse of logic. Hence, words are always connected to
metaphor (and hopefully experience) as a way of avoiding this pitfall. On the other hand, the use of metaphors
presents another challenge in that the therapist may get totally caught up in the process of painting pictures.
Telling stories and doing exercises keeps everyone awake, but the goal of willingness and deliteralization may
get lost in the mix. Focusing on one metaphor per session at most (and any given metaphor may be useful for
more than one session) is the best remedy . Most important, metaphors are adapted to fit a client's particular form
of fusion. Context always is combined with content in the client's experience for the proper and judicious use of2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 50/118
metaphor . Next -- How to determine when its time to get out of Dodge City and move on to the next stage of
ACT? First, we know there's progress when a person does not automatically respond to every troublesome
thought (or emotion) with the same overwhelming and automatic connection. They cease to automatically fuse
with their language system and instead are able to ""wake up"" and be aware of non-workable reactions,
sometimes in the very midst of the process. Second, from this evolving stance of observer to their reactions, a
person demonstrates an increased capacity for a willingness to experience content that would have previously
brought automatic fusion. In other words, they do not always and automatically respond with well worn methods
of control and avoidance. ACT  would ar gue that this occurs when a person ceases to fuse and there is a
""weakening of social/verbal context of control."" The client is able to have more dif ficult experiences and
demonstrates a willingness to set aside moves of experiential avoidance. From this point, the clinician is then
advised to observe thyself in an exercise which eventually encourages one to ""release"" attachment to cherished
notions of self, whether they be the best of things or the worst of things that you think about who you are. How
difficult is it to release our attachment to these statements about self as ""literal"" realities of who we are? Perhaps
this will develop an empathy for the challenges faced by our clients. Then we are presented with a clinical
vignette about a 31 year old man with panic attacks whose life has become constricted because he avoids
situations that produce feelings of anxiety and panic. How to conceptualize this situation? What strategies are we
to use here? An ACT  perspective would suggest that the client is confusing content with context by treating any
appearance of a dreaded symptom of anxiety and panic as a harbinger of absolute danger ahead. An ef fective
strategy would seek to use deliteralization exercises (e.g. Milk, Milk or Tin Can Monster) that encourage the
person to step back and avoid the automatic literal response (disaster is here), and instead see these experiences
as experiences -- nothing more and nothing less. Can the client allow these symptoms to occur without fusing?
Then these symptoms can take their ""natural course"" without the rollercoaster wrought by cognitive fusion.
Finally , the chapter  concludes with two exer cises for  client homework  The first seeks to analyze the extent to
which reason giving pervades experiences outside the session. This will hopefully make the client more aware of
how they use reason giving and to see reasons as merely content to be considered as useful only when they meet
the criteria of workability . The second exercise is an awareness exercise which encourages a mindfulness and
acceptance of present moment experience that helps one practice being in the role of observer . A useful and life
long task indeed.

This is all open to feedback, of course, as I am never sure I have this stuf f quite right. But then again, it's only a
bunch of thoughts, so don't believe me anyway . Somehow this self stuf f reminded me of a recent interview with
Clint Eastwood (paraphrased from memory) --
Int: So, we've talked a lot about what your critics think of you and your work, what your wife and ex-
wives and children think. I have to ask, what do you think about Clint Eastwood?
CE: I tend not to think about him very much.
ACT  (181): In order to face one's monsters head-on, it is necessary to find a place where this is possible. I
believe there is a Zen story (don't recall where I heard or read this) of a man who is alone in his house trying to
eliminate all of his demon's. One after one, he faces them down, and they all disappear as he sees them for what
they are -- except one. This is the lar gest demon of all, and as hard as the master -to-be tries, he cannot eliminate
this demon. He cannot avoid the monster , he cannot talk the demon into going away , he cannot make a deal with
the chimera. Finally , after he thinks he has attempted everything he could possibly do, he jumps right into the
mouth of the demon, and it disappears. ACT - Three Senses of Self  Conceptualized Self -- The me who I think I
am Clients come into therapy , counseling, etc with varying goals regarding this self -- to defend the self, to fix
the self, to find the self, to avoid the self ACT  View for Success Regarding the CS -- to have the client
voluntarily experience conceptual self suicide expur gate the boundaries of the self and (my thought) broaden the
psychological world of the client to make room for all history and experience - to bring the clients to where they
began and to see it again for the first time (I can't remember where I stole that one, either). Self as concept might
make a statement like ""I am a person who ....."" and this statement is taken literally with many predicates, even2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 51/118
predicates which do not work. Examples ""I am a person who breathes"" compared to ""I am a person who is sad,
happy , "" This universality can cause mucho problems. (Here's a reach) If I am a person who is sad, I may not
notice the times when I am happy- they don't fit my self concept. On the other hand, if I am a person who is
happy , what does it mean on an afternoon - when it is cold and wet and rainy in Minnesota, and it is June, and
dammit, isn't supposed to warm and sunny now - when I am sad? With this concept we, and the community
around us becomes very invested in my maintaining my ""image"" of being a certain kind of person; or
1. When I am x and I and my community do much better when I am x, I am pretty invested in remaining x,
because if I act as Y there are consequences
2. Our history has taught us to see and maintain patterns.
3. We have equivalency statements that may not be equivalent ""I am 5'10"" (maybe 9"") becomes the same as
""I am alcoholic.""
4. If I try to act outside of ""who I think I am,"" it seems almost life (or self?) threatening. Note: I wonder
about this with the ""guys"" I work with. Many are domestic violence of fenders, and even though their
physicality is usually not threatened, many lash out when their sense of ""self"" is threatened, the ""manly
man syndrome."" OR ""Eliminate conceptualization = eliminate me.""
The self can be ""maintained more easily simply by distorting or reinterpreting events if they are inconsistent with
our conceptualized self."" I am concurrently (as my bathroom bibliotherapy) reading a book - The Tao of Zen -
there is a quote there that I somehow want to fit into this chapter . You decide - "" For all Chinese philosophy is
essentially the study of how [people] can best be helped to live together in harmony and good order ... [There is]
nothing more dangerous than that theories and doctrines which belong to the world of language should be
mistaken for truths concerning the world of fact."" Our conditioned responses to and with language create the
prison which many people go into therapy to theoretically escape, and get there and work hard to build stronger
walls. Page 183 - ""T o escape a prison it is first necessary to see the prison itself."" Most therapy to date has been
designed to paint the walls of the prison with dif ferent thoughts and/or emotions, whereas ACT's design is for the
client to see the prison from both the inside and the outside. Ongoing Self Awareness  While the conceptualized
self is a verbal trap, it is still necessary to have an idea of who you are and how you are when you are there.
Without getting attached to the content, there still has to be a verbal self knowledge of life to engage with it. In
this sense, it seems it is more like a surfer riding the waves, than a swimmer battling the water , or maybe, better
yet, than a non-swimmer flailing in the waves. The surfer knows the water (language, words, content) is there,
but does not get caught up in the depth, the swirls and eddies that come along moment to moment. A thought is
just a thought, a feeling is just a feeling. The client is encouraged to engage some of these things descriptively ,
rather than evaluatively - to look at a thought, rather than through it. The Observer  Self The ""I"" is a place, a
locus, a perspective. It came about and is used to dif ferentiate my experience from the experience of others? ""I""
am looking at my computer screen. ""Y ou"" are not. The ""I"" sets up the context for description. ( I think I have this
right, or at least am making sense of it.) Spirit/Matter distinction which has emer ged in all cultures. Spirit - a
private event that cannot be experiences as a thing or object. Sense of self-as-perspective has same properties as
spirit. This is important because we/I/Y ou as context is the one place any of us can stand that is enduring. Even
though we are constantly changing, we always have that sense of ""being there,"" of seeing all that is in our life
from behind these eyes. This important in the change process because there is something grounding about there
being one part of us that will go through all of ""this"" unscathed, at least for the time we are aware of. With all of
the threatening things that happen in therapy , life, etc, there is that sense of I that will remain. ( I think) In ACT ,
it is important that the I/you-as- context will always be there, at night, in the clouds, through sleet and hail and
thunder , wherever I am, whatever happens, there I go. Page 187 - ""The trick lies in teaching the client how to be
aware of content, to be aware of the awareness of content, and yet not be so preoccupied with content or attached
to it as a matter of personal identity ... without objectifying these events or mistaking them for"" the real me. Be
careful not to pay too much ""attention to that little man behind the curtain.""

We're looking at the first part of the 'Clinical Focus' section of chapter 7 'Discovering Self, Defusing self'.
As will have been outlined earlier , this is an important part of ACT . The section begins with a brief outline of the
core perspectives that are introduced here. Table 7.1 (p.188) provides the ACT  goals, strategies and interventions
regarding self.
Initially , it is helpful to 'Undermine Attachment to a Conceptualized Self'. Clients may vary in readiness to work
on this area. The timeless struggle between content and context is presenting itself here. ACT  promotes the idea
that the problem may lie in attachment to beliefs, rather than in the beliefs themselves. This may be seen as a
reversal of some views in which self-conceptualization and performance are linked. The 'Mental Polarity
Exercise' can be used here to demonstrate the ef fects of attachment to evaluative thoughts. The description of the
exercise also describes the etymology of the word 'perfect'. This is also a powerful and important point, that, in
my view is worthy of detailed attention.
Next we have a section on 'Building Awareness of the Observing Self', that aims to help the client notice the
process of consciousness and sense of perspective. A 'central ACT  intervention', the Chessboard Metaphor , is
then described in detail, and a helpful brief therapist/client transcript provided. The Chessboard metaphor can be
physically acted out in therapy . Issues such as willingness can be demonstrated through observing how little
effort it takes for the board to hold the pieces. An important phrase - "" The point is that thoughts, feelings,
sensations, memories etc are pieces on the board, they are not you"" (p.192).
A couple of notes fr om a beginner:  As p.189 notes, 'therapists and clients are in this language stew together'. It is
therefore as important for therapists to work on attachment to their own conceptualized self(-ves), as for the
client (a theme of the book). I especially like the brief paragraph on perfect (p.190). In this sense, who is not
'thoroughly made'? This perspective may also carry over to the judgments and evaluations we make of others.
The Chessboard Metaphor is very useful - although I have had one or two clients wanting to sweep all of the
pieces from the board (wipe the slate clean). John Billing gave us alternative metaphor on 16.06.04 (or 06.16.04,
depending on which side of the pond you're on)

Experiential Exer cise with the Observer  Self Observer Self exercise: This is a ""key"" lengthy exercise that
brings the person to the place where they are observing the changes that have occurred in their life from a
perspective that seemingly does not change. Phase1 : The exercise begins with general focusing and by noticing
bodily sensations. From there it moves onto observing sensations of a recent memory; then to observing a further
away memory , then lastly it moves to observing sensations of a distant memory . The main focus is on being
aware of the self that was present at those past moments is the same self that is presently noticing; the observer
self is a sort of common denominator; it's the soul prospective. It is also practice in ""seeing seeing"" where seeing
is defined as what we feel, think, and sense. Phase2 : Is similar to what occurred in Phase1, just the content has
changed. The client is guided through observing the roles they play and the emotions and thoughts that they
have; roles, thoughts, and emotions change, come and go but there is a you that is having them and has stayed
the same while they have changed. The perspective of Observer Self is one where a person can more easily
observe themselves engaging in the behaviors of thinking and sensing. Paraphrasing Skinner , ""a person who is
aware of his own behavior is in a better position to [influence] his behavior ."" Pick an identity : This is an exercise
where a few semi-random statements about a self are picked from a box, randomly , and then the client uses these
statements to take on that personality , with the help of some guidance. This equates to the client's real life
experience of picking a few statements about themselves and becoming that person. This is an experience in
flexibility where being flexible has not been utilized (much). Faking it : is a good example of how our minds' can
give us the opposite experience of what we actually experience. ""I feel like a fake because I am having a good
time but I am not a person who has a good time; I'm depressed! Therefore I must be having a good time just to2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 53/118
make other's feel like I am having a good time (which of-course I couldn't be). Since I am a fraud this really
sucks."" The benefits of being able to observe these thoughts as thoughts and not truths should be obvious.
Buying these thoughts will lead to one experience where the experience itself yields or is a much dif ferent
experience.

Here is my attempt at the next couple of section called ""Therapeutic Do's and Don'ts"", ""Progress To The Next
Phase"", ""Personal Work For The Clinician: Is Your Self Getting In The Way?"", and ""Clinical Vignette"". In the fist
section ""Therapeutic Do's and Don'ts"", the authors caution clinicians about a couple of things. First ""Reinforcing
the Problem"", in this section we a cautioned about joining in with the client's language, which will show ""itself
in the development of an excessive amount of logical, rational talk about why the client can't trust his or her
thoughts, the lack of self-confidence, and so on."" I usually see this rearing it ugly head when I realize that I am
talking way to much, and at times trying to convince the client of something. At these moments the authors
suggest we return the focus to ""experiential exercises and metaphorical talk."" We should also ""Reaf firm for
clients that there is no secret formula that delivers happiness in any consistent way ."" Because, inevitably we want
to take our new found tools for living and turn them into shovels and start digging new holes. Next ""Spirituality
As An Experience, Not A Religion"", warns of the dangers of seeing ACT  as a religion. This is a pitfall that we
have seen since the beginning of AA, where they warned of being swept up in a religious zeal. These new ways
of living daily can bring with it a new found spiritual awakening, and as the book says ""that is gravy ."" As
therapist, we need to ""emphasize the concept of workability for the client, not a belief system."" Next ""The
Multiproblem Client And Self-Obliteration"", in this section the authors deal briefly with the topic of more
seriously dysfunctional individuals. I see this section as boiling down to two sentences from the section. One,
""The destructive ef fects of trauma lie less in the event per se than in the escape and avoidance maneuvers used to
compensate for the event."", and Two, ""ACT  strongly promotes the use of experiential and metaphorical exercises
that undermine the need for avoidance with such clients."" And isn't that the lesson to learn? This reminds me of a
poem I once wrote; ""Lost and Found I lost what I was looking for Because I was looking for what I hadn't found.
I hope I find what I'm Looking for Before I've lost what I find that I found."" Next ""Progress To The Next Phase"",
how do we know when it is time to move on to the next stage? When clients start to speak of ""looking at, rather
than being caught up in, private experiences."" The authors also state ""Another critical sign at this stage is the
ability to laugh at oneself in earnest."" In my own life it shows when I spontaneously think of how I ""dig my
holes"" and can laugh to myself as I say ""Mark, step awayyyyyy from the shovel."" Next ""Personal Work For The
Clinician: Is Your Self Getting In The Way?"", this is where you break out your pad and pen, and get a chance to
play along at home. In this section we are suppose to look at the ""monsters"" we have been avoiding in our own
lives. This is not for the squeamish, but it can be truly freeing. I will share one of my ""Monsters"", but I suggest
you use your own. ""Remember to save your work."" (My ""Monster"" is the internal circus that happens every time
I am called Doctor .) 1. What emotion does this problem present that is most dif ficult for you to deal with? (When
this happens, fear rushes through me, and I think someone is going to expect me to be something.) 2. What
thought(s) does this problem present that is most dif ficult for you to deal with? (That I am unworthy , and
inadequate) 3. What memory or personal history does this problem present that is dif ficult? (I have many
memories of being told in High School that I wasn't college material, and that the best I could hope for was
maybe getting in the military .) 4. Is there anything in these private experiences that, considered on their own
terms, you cannot have and still live a vital life? If you can't have them or a part of them, just notice you are not
having that part. (I don't think this issue for me rises to this level, however , there are times that it gets in the way
of me making my opinion known.) 5. Are you willing to get into contact with these emotions, thoughts,
memories right now? If so, practice having them in a new context. For example, if there is a horrible thought,
say the thought out loud 50 times as fast as you can. If it's painful feeling, hold the feeling in your mind and
mentally describe its shape, color , texture, temperature, or smell. Try to see it as a feeling and see yourself
feeling it. If it's a painful memory , consider holding it in mind and separating out the physical sensations first,
then put them ""out there,"" then move on to the emotions and put them out there, then the images and put them
out there. (I have found that when separating out the sensations, emotions, and images that I can move in to the
present without the negative ef fects of these past experiences.) 6. As you consider each of these content areas,2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 54/118
notice also that a conscious person is considering them. Review items 1 to 5, but this time see whether you can
also be aware of the person ""behind the eyes"" who is aware of what you are aware of. (W ow, that was a trip. You
may need to be in a quiet place to try this, but it seemed as if I was invading my own body .) Finally ""Clinical
Vignette"", here you are asked to ""conceptualize the client's dilemma from an ACT  viewpoint."" This is a good
exercise that folks can check out in the book starting on page 202.

What ar e values?  1. Values represent ""verbally constructed global desired life consequences"", dif ferent from
goals in that they specify a more general direction and hence can not ultimately be satisfied, completed or
achieved. For example the goal of completing this summary serves a lar ger goal of learning about ACT , that is
consistent with my life value of continuing to learn as much as I can about psychology and its disciplines. Values
typically elicit a number of goals, that is, values are ""a verbal glue that holds sets of goals together"". 2. Values
are an action, not a feeling. Values are followed through behaviour , not through it necessarily ""feeling right"". 3.
Values are a more stable form of ""verbal rules"" re-aligning a client in the present to a valued direction. Thoughts
and feelings can be contradictory and inconsistent. 4. The main goal of ACT  is help clients develop a
""behavioural trajectory"" that is vital and valued. 5. All of the techniques in ACT  feed this main goal. Techniques
such as defusion and acceptance are only useful in so far that they provide a means for a client to achieve a
valued end. Are values innate or  learned?  6. All clients have the capacity to define their life direction (i.e.
develop values) 7. Verbal fusion and experiential avoidance are common barriers to following these values 8.
Developing values is linked more to removing barriers (e.g., verbal fusion) rather than needing to teach valuing
skills. 9. A lack of values in a client may reflect a chaotic, unpredictable environment, where the development of
values/goals has met with frequently painful or disappointing consequences. 10. The social/verbal community
requires that we have explanations or justification for our actions. Citing values may not appease this
community , hence they are not always socially reinforced. Why have them?  11. People's behaviour is shaped by
consequences, both experienced and verbally constructed. While learning histories provide a means of shaping
behaviour over the short term, language provides the means by which behaviour can be shaped over longer
periods (i.e., knowing that I will receive my degree at the end of 4 years keeps me studying, even though short
term consequences can be somewhat aversive). 12. Values are part of this language process, specifying long term
consequences for current behaviour . They can coordinate current actions over long time frames and since they
are global, they require a person to do this on a day-to-day basis, dif ferent from specific goals in that they are not
achievable per se. Stance of the ACT  therapist with r egards to values : 13. ACT  therapists are asking clients a
number of questions with regards to values: 1) What are your values (this will be explored with other people's
summaries) 2) Can you act in a way that is consistent with your values, even when your thoughts or feelings tell
you otherwise?"" 3) What stands in the way of you acting in accordance with your values? 4) In pursuing a
valued life direction, are you willing to have what emer ges, what you encounter along the way? 5) Is there a
difference between feeling a belief and acting on a belief? How will others know? (The ""ar gyle socks exercise""
is a useful way of addressing some of these questions)

ACT  Book Summary: Pages 212 - 219
This is a section I find very compelling and challenging. It has parts I can put into words but don't understand. It
has other parts I understand, but can't put into words (Should the ""buts"" be ""ands""?). At least it seems that way to
me. I can put into words the dif ference between judgments and choices but can't seem to dif ferentiate in practical
examples. I have, for example, a vague feeling for where I want to go with the or ganization I manage. This feels
like a value. I want everyone to be relatively happy and do a good job. That seems like a goal. What's my value
here? I begin with ""Choice"" on page 212. Choice is distinguished from judgment-almost as a residual category
(defined by what it isn't) of behavioral processes with certain characteristics that are used to select among
alternatives. A selection among alternatives based on reasons is a judgment. Reasons are verbal formulations of2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 55/118
cause and ef fect which answer the question ""why?"". The formulations serve as a justification of sorts which may
make reference to societal or personal outcomes or use quasi scientific historically based deterministic
assertions. For example, ""I eat fruits and vegetables because they clean out my system"". A choice is a selection
among alternatives that may be made with reasons but not for reasons. The live demonstrative exercise is to of fer
your fists and say , ""Choose!"". The client points to one. When ask ""Why?"", he may or may not formulate a
reason; but most persons will realize that the reason is formulated after the act of choosing and therefore not
functioning causally in the selection process. In a judgment, the weighing of pros and cons actually influences
the outcome of the selection process. For example, ""I was going to hire Mr . Smith because of his job skills. I
decided not to hire him when I considered his poor health."" Is it a judgment because my awareness of Mr .
Smith's health problems precede my selection of Mr . Jones? Would it have been a choice if I met them both,
wanted to hire Mr . Jones but didn't do so until I found out about Mr . Smith's health? Then there's this business on
213 and 214 about asking why a reason is true as a way undermining the causal relationship between the reason
and the selection(in the mind of the client, that is). Or asking why a food is chosen and then when they say it
tastes good you say you asked the person to choose and not their taste buds. Maybe this is over my head. The
authors acknowledge that there is no ""free choice"" in a scientific sense. Is this then a question of creating the
subjective illusion of ""free choice"" by impeachment of reason(or reason giving)? This seems to be the point of
the paragraph at the end of this section. I can't quite grasp this. Help me Francis or Patty or Hank or someone.
Valuing is always occurring as a behavior . The dialogue between Therapist and Client on page 215 is to show
how choices are always being made and purposes fulfilled. The point here does not seem to be to elucidate how
these selections among alternatives are choices rather than judgments even though the word ""choice"" is used.
Perhaps this follows in some logical way from the previous section. Still the implication is that clients are not
conscious of the selection among alternatives process being ""choice making"" and this dialogue will make them
so. What do you want your life to stand for? The dialogue is with an independently wealthy client presumably
because such an unfortunate is stripped of the illusion that working for a living guides life, I guess. Anyway , they
do the exercise about attending the client's funeral and what he wishes everyone would say . The therapist
comments that he doesn't expect them to say ""...he was no fluke."" I think this is to make the point that avoiding
negatives is out as a value in the sense that we're after here(File it. Along with judgments and stuf f determined
by reasons). They're mainly trying to distinguish values, whatever they are, from the clients current real life
actions. This section ends with Albert Schweitzer as an example of someone known by what he stood for rather
than specific accomplishments and it recommends the values assessment homework assignment (pages 224-
225). We'll get to that shortly . I wish I could've gone to Dr . Wilson's ABA  workshop on this; but I chose Prof.
Barnes-Holmes' RFT  workshop (or was it a judgment? Does it matter how I think I arrived at the selection
among alternatives?). Choice and Commitment . If actions are based on reasons and reasons change, then ""true
commitments"" are better done as choices than as judgments. The heart of the ACT  life strategy seems to be to
develop a life direction in the behavioral sense relatively independent of thoughts and impulses of the moment.
The marriage commitment is given as an example of a commitment that is undermined 50% of the time by
divorce. The authors see the ""cause"" of divorce as the persons involved not knowing how to make commitments
and marrying on the basis of judgments, decisions, and reasons-therefore not having made a commitment at all
by our definition (right?). Is this logic circular? Does it follow that divorce can have no other cause? Maybe so-
for our purposes. Anyway , the experience (private event?) of falling in and out of love is rather unpredictable
compared to the ""choice"" quality of commitment. This frames things in a way that life can be lived dif ferently
for some than those who ""believe"" in love feelings as a guideline for action taking. They conclude that
commitments are choices free of reasons and changeable verbal cover and suggest the Chessboard Metaphor and
Gardening Metaphor as ways to illustrate conceptually .

This section relates how needing to attain goals creates motivation and direction for action, but does not provide
vitality in life. Attaining goals does not equal happiness or life satisfaction, as one is forced to live in a constant
state of deprivation (interestingly , it is pointed out that the etymology of the word ""want"" is ""missing"").
The Gardening Metaphor describes how to stick it out with an initial choice (i.e., value) to see what happens
(without believing that the ""grass is greener on the other side,"" no pun intended). Another ""goal"" in this phase of
therapy is to help clients see that the process of living equals the outcome of interest. The Skiing Metaphor
describes this well. Your stated ""goal"" may be to get down to the lodge and you are planning to ski there. If
someone whisks you of f in a helicopter to bring you to the lodge, that would make you mad. It is the process of
getting to the lodge (i.e., skiing) that is what is to be enjoyed.
Finally , process cannot be measured from moment to moment like goals. If one continually monitors progress
toward specific goals, they may miss the "" big picture"" (i.e., what they have accomplished to date). Here the Path
up the Mountain Metaphor comes into play . It highlights what is wrong with monitoring only ""snapshots"" of life.
If you are hiking up a mountain, you may notice twists and turns, circling around (perhaps even going down the
path in parts) ultimately to get up the mountain. You may think at any given time: ""I'm doing well"" (for instance
on an up-path) or conversely: ""I'm doing poorly"" (on a down-path). Yet, an observer with binoculars across the
way (looking down at the hikers) may notice steady , continuous progress toward the overall goal.
Values Clarification: Setting the Compass Heading
In this section, values work is further elaborated. The authors point out that doing values work can be an intimate
experience between therapist and client, as oftentimes values are not something the client has ever articulate
before to someone else. One of the ""values"" of ""values work"" is in the fact that values may help point out to
clients what IS working in their lives (i.e., they may be leading valued lives in certain areas they hadn't even
recognized). There are some values worksheets on page 224. There are three forms, including a values narrative
form, values assessment rating form, and goals, actions, barriers form you can use with clients. The goal is to
review the worksheets together and build on them. Values work may be a helpful assessment tool as well. In
doing the values work, therapists can uncover possible ""ulterior motives"" for certain values. The authors give
three examples:
1. when values statements are controlled by the presence of the therapist, the consequence can be therapist
approval or lack of disapproval.
2. when values statements are controlled the presence of the culture more generally , the consequence can be
the absence of cultural sanctions, broad social approval, or prestige.
3. when values statements are controlled by stated or assumed values of the client's parents, the consequence
can be parental approval
This is not to say that these factors don't af fect EVER YONE'S values, but the extent to which the client takes
ownership of their values is important to assess. When a client is wedded to the consequences mentioned above,
the therapist can ask the client what would happen if the stated consequences were not there (i.e., ""What if your
parents did not know you received a Ph.D.?""). Another point the authors make is that it is not uncommon for
values to change in valence over the course of therapy . Sometimes (oftentimes) clients may leave certain (or
many) domains completely empty . In this situation it can be helpful for the therapist to ask the client what values
he/she held earlier in life.
Assessing Goals and Actions
After values work is underway , the focus is on developing goals and specifying the actions that can be taken to
achieve those goals. A goal is define as a specific achievement, accomplished in the service of a particular value.
Clients do homework in acting according to values either as a one-time deal or from a commitment to repeated
and regular acts in the service of a given value. The therapist and client monitor for a close connection between
action, goal, and value and try to ""accumulate small positives."" The authors assert that little steps consistently
taken are more useful than heroic steps taken inconsistently . What to do about barriers? The authors mention that
engaging in valued action almost always provokes a psychological reaction (often in the form of barriers). At2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 57/118
these times, clients may get stuck because they avoid taking values actions as a means of avoiding painful
emotional barriers. The therapist then helps the client examine:
1. the type of barrier
2. ask if the barrier is something they can make room for and still act
3. find out what aspect of the barrier may actually help reducing your willingness to have it without defense
4. assess whether barriers are a form of emotional control or avoidance
Question
Although I am a big proponent of values work (or I wouldn't be doing this therapy), I am still struck by the
similarity of values homework to ""monitoring progress toward a goal,"" not noticing the process itself. In other
words, the question ""How well did you move toward this goal this week by these actions"" seems like the very
""snapshot"" that is proposed as problematic in the initial part of this section. Any reactions?

Willingness to have barriers and barriers to willingness: willingness is a value-based action, a choice: see the
""Bubble in the road"" metaphor p. 230. Therapeutic do's and don'ts:
coercive use of choice: conflicts are possible between the therapist's and the client's values. Take care not
to use ""choice"" as a way to blame the client.
confusing values and goals: ""I want to be happy"" is not a value. It's no direction. It's something you can
have or not have, like an object. Values cannot be achieved and maintained. Helping question: ""What
would you be able to do if that was accomplished?"" Values are no means to an end.

Willingness and commitment: putting ACT  into action  ACT  is not only about defusing and defining life
values. Essentially ACT  is all about living, action. This chapter focuses on the commitment part of ACT : ""getting
the client engage in valued actions while making room for their intended or unintended consequences"".
Theor etical focus  Willingness & behavioral commitment = actively engaging in actions that may invite the
presence of negative evaluated thoughts, emotions, and bodily states. This induces a confrontation with the
unworkable aspects of old rule systems. Verbal and nonverbal aspects are important here. Verbal : formulating
valued ends & intermediate goals Nonverbal : through action, actual movement, behavior can actual
contingencies be met. Nonverbal behavior is necessary to find out what actually works. The dif ference with
systematic exposure and behavior change lies in the focus on overt situations + on private events. The emer gence
of the old rule systems is helpful in the defusion process. Goal of this phase  = to elicit behavior & to support the
client's commitment to sustaining such change. Comments : - ultimately ACT  is no talk therapy , it's behavior
therapy . No behavior therapy without action. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. -old rule systems can be
very though. Is it possible to change them in old people, with problem histories of tens of years?

Willingness and Commitment  chapter Clinical Focus  1. The goal of clinical work in this section is to elicit
behavior change and support the client's commitment to sustaining this change. 2. Therapeutic topics center
around willingness and committed action. 3. There is a chart with goals, strategies, and interventions related to
willingness and commitment on page 239. My comments : 4. The authors note that committed action is ""funded
by valuing."" I find that description very helpful! Experiential Qualities of Applied Willingness  5. The
experiential piece of willingness relates to increasing the client's ability to detect internal struggles and abandon
them-even in the midst of the most dif ficult moments. 6. The authors dif ferentiate willingness from wanting in
that often clients feel that they have to want something to do it. They also often feel that if they withhold
willingness to have X, X will go away (yet they experience just the opposite). 7. Joe the Bum metaphor (page
24) is used to illustrate willingness. * This metaphor underscores two characteristics of the fantasy of
unwillingness: 1) If only invited and wanted guests came to the party , life would be grand. 2) Withholding
willingness to welcome the unwanted guest will somehow promote peace of mind. My comments : 8. I am struck
by how often we expect life to be rosy and don't want anything to happen to upset the applecart, when that's just
a frightening way to live! Willingness Has an All-or -nothing Quality  9. There is an old Zen saying: ""Y ou
cannot jump a canyon in two steps."" The authors provide an experiential exercise on page 241 related to the
simile: ""willingness is like jumping."" They discuss how the quality of jumping is the same whether one chooses
to jump of f of a book on the floor , off of a chair onto the floor , and of f of a building to the ground. It is merely
the context that changes and limits willingness. When you try to change the quality of willingness (for example,
by trying to reach your toe to the ground from the book or chair), you destroy it altogether . My comments : 10.
Maybe someday I'll be gutsy enough to jump of f a chair in my of fice in the service of illustrating this point to a
client-I'll have to commit to that J Reconnecting with Values, Goals, and Actions  11. At this stage, the therapist
reviews the client's contemplated actions in each life domain. 12. While some domains may not be filled in, it is
important to develop at least one high priority tar get and to keep the focus on willingness, not barriers. 13. A
couple of therapist statements to illustrate the above are: ""What stands in the way of you setting your willingness
on high right now?"" (the therapist noting the barriers the client cites) and ""Has being unwilling worked to protect
you over the long haul from those reactions?"" Committed Action as a Pr ocess  14. It is not unusual for clients to
avoid making a commitment because of the fear of failure to keep it. 15. There is a therapist-client dialogue on
pages 243-244 demonstrating the dif ference between process and outcome (and how to help the client see this
difference). My comments : 16. I think it's crucial in any behavior change undertaken by humans to realize
(intellectually and experientially) that it is a process, and one will inevitably ""fall of f the wagon."" I attribute this
to ""stress inoculation"" or the Zen meditative notion of guiding one's wandering mind back to task.

The section titled ""Committed Action Invites Obstacles"" begins with the idea that once we have a value-guided
game plan, it is time to act. The Eye Contact Exercise is a live demonstration of action and a way to begin to
behaviorally confront a common avoidance behavior . This exercise may elicit the reactions described. My
experience has been also that many of the client's friends, relatives and acquaintances may perceive a change in
the client as eye contact improves. Sometimes it gives them ""the creeps"". An action oriented, surprisingly
powerful intervention. The FEAR and ACT  algorithms are introduced as help aids in identifying barriers to
willingness(Fusion with thoughts, Evaluation of experiences, Avoidance of experiences, and Reason giving for
behavior) and maintaining focus on the game plan(Accept your reactions and be present, Choose a valued
direction, and Take action). These can be printed on cards and carried. Live confrontational exercises in the
therapy hour are suggested and the ""Looking for Mr . Discomfort Exercise"" is described on page 247. There's the
business of renegotiating the clients relationship with ""Mr . Discomfort"" and possible use of earlier references to
the Passengers on the Bus Metaphor . ""Culprits"" or likely suspects in failure to complete committed action sited
in the book are actions not connected to client's valued ends(direction?) with possible influence by wishes of
others, being hooked on literality bolstered by destructive reason giving, or taking a step that is too lar ge or with
insuf ficient preparation. There is also the tip in exposure exercises of identifying component experiences(bodily
sensations, memories, emotions, thoughts) and being willing to have them rather than what it says it is or may
become. There is also the technical tip of reminding awareness of external environment while encountering
negative private experiences. This is helpful when the client ""can't stand it"" and resorts to devaluing the valued2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 59/118
end(direction?). The authors' use of ""valued end"" in this section bothers me as it seems to raise the specter of
goals rather than the previously emphasized compass direction. The Swamp Metaphor on page 248 helps
illustrate the idea of walking ""through pain the service of taking a valued direction"". The Expanding Balloon
Metaphor considers the edge of the balloon as a growth zone where the question is asked: ""Are you big enough
to have this?"" You may respond to each issue with a yes or no. Yes, you get bigger . No, you get smaller . No
matter how big you get, there's always more ""big"" to get. It does not get easier (very important) as each issue
may seem relatively as dif ficult. It may become habitual, however , which begins to provide a source of strength
and confidence in the process. Figure 9.1 illustrates how avoided issues cause one to distort life around the issue
until it is faced. The Take Your Keys with You Metaphor additionally helps deal with the relationship between
avoidance and action. The keys represent dif ficult emotions, thoughts, reactions, sensations, etc. The client may
pick up and carry the keys without them preventing the action and the keys may open doors(an illusion to
insight?) The metaphor is given on page 250 and its use creates a tangible for the client to use in his outside
therapy life. I'm surprised at how few comments there are on the summaries. These metaphors can restructure a
persons' cognitive experience of life and facilitate behavior change. Is it a form of insight? Is that an important
question? Is anyone else bothered by the ""valued end"" versus ""valued direction"" thing? Is it important? Why or
why not? The idea that willingness never gets easier and can't be done piecemeal strikes me as important. I take
an exercise class that seems to have this characteristic. It involves recurrent unpleasant private experiences, but
doesn't seem to harm or traumatize me. The instructor reminds us, ""If this was easy , everyone would be in here
doing this."" Is this an example of acceptance in service of health as a valued direction? I can tell you, it never
gets easier . Do the FEAR and ACT  algorithms que rule directed behavior? Could they have a down side?

Primary barriers to committed action :
When a client resists committed action, often the client is struggling with how the action will alter his (or her)
personal history; how the client has created in his own mind his place in his world. The client may also be
grappling with the impact this history has had on his conceptualized self. The client has constructed a self
perception of who he is. If he has been subjected to an abusive or otherwise harmful environment, his self
perception embraces how he has been victimized by others.
Not surprisingly , the client is threatened with the possibility of positive change. This threat challenges both the
client's self perception and the hope that an abuser may someday validate the client's self perception and make
amends. For example, a client was physically abused as a child. He now perceives himself as a victim of
physical abuse; the perception is intertwined with his identity . If he makes positive change, he may no longer
appear as a victim to himself or his abuser . He loses his self perceived identity (as a victim).
Clients with history of painful events (especially in childhood) may have learned that life can be unpredictable
and punitive. By limiting their exposure to painful thoughts, they mistakenly believe they can curb their sense of
trauma. The opposite is often true. Psychological pain hurts but does not damage; whereas psychological trauma
is pain without the willingness to experience the pain. This unwilling causes damage; the ef fect of the pain
persist.
An exercise to teach the dif ference between psychological pain and trauma:
1. Ask the client to describe past painful and traumatic events in detail. 
      - distinguish between the original pain and, 
      - the client's reaction to the events.
2.  Inventory the area of responses (i.e. physical reactions, emotional reactions, memories, thoughts, etc.)2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 60/118
3.  Note the sense of trauma
4.  As the client becomes aware of the reaction, ask the client to let go of the struggle with the reaction.
The client's willingness will shift the context of the events; this change will often reduce the client's tension
related to the event. As a consequence, the client will be begin to distinguish between trauma and pain. The pain
will remain; the trauma will disappear; positive change may occur . A client's reluctance and resistance can be
expected. If so, the clinician should:
1. point out to the client the burdened caused by resisting the avoided content
2. have the client notice physical, emotional and cognitive responses that attach to the unwillingness
3. prompt the client to let go of the struggle with unwillingness and be willing to be unwilling
4. if the client is able to do this, ask the client to notice the dif ference between struggle and letting go
5. encourage the client to continue the process of letting go and bringing up avoided material.
Things to r emember :
The therapist must identify the functional connection between failing to be ""right"" about being a victim
and remaining a victim who demands redress.
If the client believes he must remain ""broken"" in order to prove someone else wrong, the client is stuck,
not broken.
Intervention is delicate.
The events in question are not being disputed.
What is being disputed is the necessity of living in a self defeating life in the service of waiting for the
recognition and redress that seldom, if ever , comes.

Guilt and Self-loathing  (not in Las Vegas, not Hunter Thompson) Guilt = ""I'm bad"" is a stance that weakens the
client's valuing ability . It is connected to past, dead behavior , and, when functionally connected to such a
chimera, prevents the client from living in the present, in real time, and moving ahead with life.. In the example
shown, the client implies that guilt/shame regarding past behavior is making a visit with a brother an
extraordinarily stressful event. The client holds on to contradictory concepts, ""I want to be close to my brother ,
so I cannot tell him the truth."" The client is feeling numerous emotions, and seems to get that he is trying to
bargain with them, and get them to the back of the bus. When he sees the cognitive dissonance (?), he appears to
be able to also see the disconnect, which scares him. Therapist asks what is between him and honesty with his
brother -- answer: fear , He can bring that to the front of the bus as well and is still able to drive. Forgiveness
Clients often think fear is a change in stance where once they 'knew' someone was wrong, bad, untrustworthy ,
and to for give is to say they are no longer these things, they are right, good, etc. The client has, in essence,
changed their mind. It can also appear to be emotional avoidance -- excusing, denying, for getting old angers. It is
actually a gift to oneself, to give the self that which came before. It gives the for -giver the ability to regain the
grace under which they can neutralize the injustices -within themselves. To paraphrase ""the injustices of others
can only be made permanent by the victim, not the perpetrator ,"" or pain is unavoidable, but suf fering is optional.
Example used is the Gestalt ""empty chair"" exercise. It may be best to allow the client work on the pivotal,
profoundly personal issue of for giveness outside of the session, where the necessary privacy and time for self-
reflection is available. Behavior  When the client is nearing the end of the willingness and commitment phase,
ACT  begins to resemble other Behavior Therapy , while maintaining an ACT  flavor . Skill building, couples work,
role-playing et al, are used from an ACT  perspective. Termination  Termination comes when the client has
reached a point where valued behavior change has been actualized for him or her . Therapy is not designed to be
permanent -- Woody Allen ""I have been in Analysis for twenty years. I think I will give it another ten and if that
doesn't work, I will call it quits."" It is to help the client get unstuck. When a client shows openness to change, a
rating scale may be used to gauge further commitment to same. Termination may be tapered of f, shorter for the2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

functional client, and longer for the multiple problem client. This phase is used to bolster key ACT  principles
(Oh how quickly we for get) and for relapse prevention. This, thinking of diClemente's stages of change, is the
maintenance and transition stage. During this period, if the need to reenter therapy arises, the therapist will be
aware of it during these phasing out visits.

THERAPEUTIC DO'S AND DON'TS Even in Relapse, Values ar e Permanent  When client is experiencing a
relapse, the first thing therapist and client must know is if there's a change in client's values. Most of the times,
there's not a change in values but on client's confidence to achieve them. When client experiences a relapse,
there's probably inner conflictive talk about dif ferent rules and memories. If the therapist confirms that the
client's values are the same, he can use a metaphor to say that even though obstacles may show up in the way ,
the way to arrive to the committed goal is the same. omments : What if the client's approach to his value allows
him to foresee a ""danger"" (such as the non accomplishment of other values). On the other hand, the client might
answer that if one is tired to drive to San Francisco it is not recommendable to do it, or that if he knows the road
is blocked because of an accident, he should wait till another day or month. My comment might be silly but
since my short therapeutic experience, clients are very good at refuting and turning over all kind of metaphors
adjusting them to their immediate needs. The Client Owns Committed Action  In this section, the authors
emphasize the importance that the client follows his own values and not the ones that might be a non intentional
influence of the therapist. Noncompliance is not Failur e When client's behavior doesn't change, therapists use
to think it's a failure, and when this happen, therapist pushes the client to act according to his own values (the
ones of the client). That strategy doesn't lead to a good outcome, and client's behavior gets resistant or definitely
avoidant. The best way to cope with that situation is to accept the client's struggle and non-action from the point
of view of the client. Comments : It's interesting to me that in this situation the main problem is not the client's
resistance, but the therapist resistance to accept the client's behavior . PERSONAL  WORK FOR THE
CLINICIAN: COMMITTED ACTION In this exercise, the therapist takes one value and establishes goals,
actions and obstacles according to it. Then, the therapist thinks about which private events would show up once
committed action begins and if he is decided to make room for them. Comments : it's very interesting to me the
difference between ACT  approach and CBT . In my clinical experience as a CBT  I remember that after the
assessment and before treatment, we had to write down together the client's goals, but most of the times, even
though classifying them in dif ferent areas and making a hierarchy , there was a lack of certain ""structure"", not
only in the result but also in the process of ""outcoming"" goals, so the goal sessions used to be quite
unsatisfactory . CLINICAL  VIGNETTE In this section, the authors expose an example of how a client can
mislead committed action as a process, and as an outcome. The client relates ""drinking again"" to not to be a
""loving and emotionally available husband"", so he experiences negative private events. But he should consider
""drinking again"" as an obstacle which is part of the whole process, and not the outcome. The other point of the
example to stand out is that the client misleads blame and responsibility . But considering ""drinking again"" as part
of a process and not as an outcome, he would understand that he is able to choose again from now on. Three
metaphors are provided. APPENDIX: CLIENT  HOMEWORK Accepting Yourself on Faith Exercise The
therapist dif ferentiates between conclusion and assumption, and defines assumption (something we use to do
other work). Then, after checking that the client validates himself making a conclusion, impels the client to
choose the assumption that he is acceptable and valid. That's called Faith Exercise. When the client chooses to be
acceptable, some contents such as self-doubt depend on the previous assumption and so they loose their
meaning. Comments : I understand that assumptions are so frequent and necessary as breathing, and also, that
approaching the problem of self acceptance might be easier and quicker that way . But I think that self validity
can be approached from a filogenetical point of view . What we are is the outcome of millions of years of
environmental and social selection. That has a great value per se, and is not an assumption. If we have being
selected is that we are good. But on the other hand I understand that sometimes that's something dif ficult and
maybe long to explain. What do you all think about it?

The Effective ACT  Therapeutic Relationship  The chapter begins with the statement that the therapist stance
towards the client and therapy is an important variable, and as a result therapy becomes an intense experience for
both, client and therapist. Then, the problem of language traps is introduced as a process in which the therapist
may fall down itself. The beginning of the chapter also announces the possibilities and limitations of all
therapeutic relationships, their lights and shadows. Comments : the last passage of this page makes me think that
in a therapeutic relationship, due to the fact that there's a short history of contingencies between client and
therapist, words in that context have a great amount of relations, and so, the range of meanings is wide. For
example, when talking to an old and close friend, some words, sentences or non verbal behaviors have an unique
meaning. Usually it happens the opposite in therapy . Positive leverage points in ACT  As a main feature of ACT
stance it is presented its sensitivity: its open, accepting and coherent stance towards client. But the paradox of
using rule governed behavior to direct and influence the therapist behavior is presented in a quick and clearly
way. Comments : I ask myself which are the historical antecedents and conditions that lead to a sensitive
therapist. Understanding the word ""sensitivity"" as a track to therapists is important, but I think that every kind of
human relationship called therapy , shares (regarding other psychological models) the fact that therapy is an art,
and art is a practice. And in that sense I think that the beginnings of all kind of therapy are mechanical, not only
because of the model but mainly because of the lack of experience. ACT  in a functional sense  Then, the authors
present an example of a therapist being caught up by the literal meaning of an internal event and the possible
consequences of it. The point referred is not how to ""resolve the problem"" but how to accept the fact of
experiencing this kind of thoughts. The therapist itself must become a living flesh example of individual being
stuck by a rule (""Good therapists would know what to do in that case"") that accepts its own inner events and
commits to therapy goals. Comments : I like the fact that the possible interventions of therapist are not a
memorizeable standardized list of sentences, just contingencied, spontaneous responses. Otherwise, I like the
impel to consider therapy as a struggle DURING therapy and not a previously manufactured ""solution"".
Observer  Perspective  Another of the positive leverages of ACT  is an observer perspective that takes an
extremely care in not rationalizing and justifying through verbal behavior our private events. The ACT  model
emphasizes the importance of the acquisition of this skill by the therapist, ar guing that the way the therapist
behaves during therapy regarding internal events is important to influence the way the client will behave itself.
Comments : following the ar gument I agree that personal growing and maturity of the therapist is a fundamental
variable in therapy Wisdom is Gained by Appr oach, Not Avoidance  And as an end to my summary , the authors
explain the dif ference between achieving goals and values and the stance of coping them despite of ""secondary
effects"" hung on them. They say that therapist should show this stance during therapy , and furthermore, that they
should have experienced such a coping stance. An ef fective ACT  therapist is the outcome of that condition.
Comments : I appreciate the dif ference between merely achieving goals and to live while achieving goals. I
always thought that a goal oriented stance was not enough.

Contradiction and uncertainty: the willingness to entertain contradictory themes of uncertainties without feeling
compelled to use verbal behavior or verbal reasoning to resolve them. Two things come to mind: The test of a
first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still r etain the ability
to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things ar e hopeless and yet be determined to make them
otherwise.  - F. Scott Fitzgerald And ""Alice laughed: ""There's no use trying,"" she said; ""one can't believe
impossible things."" ""I daresay you haven't had much practice,"" said the Queen. ""When I was younger , I always
did it for half an hour a day . Why , sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.""
The phrase ""field of play"" seems apt to me. When I am in ACT  mode with a client, it does feel like play , even if
we're working on heavy painful stuf f. Field of possibility is another way I think of it. No guarantees, no
warranties-just living. My clients and I have a bus metaphor when we talk about the impermanence of life. Years
ago, when I was making another appointment with a client, he told me he planned to be there, but as John
Lennon said, ""Life is what happens when you're busy making plans,"" and that either of us could be hit by a bus.
He was right and I try to remember it. It seems to me that this awareness leads right into values work. If you
have no guarantee that you will survive the day , how does that af fect what you're doing right now? Tolerate2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

paradox, ambiguity , confusion and irony . I suppose you'd have to be a fan of Monty Python, then, hey? I still
find the rescuing bit hard not to buy . Getting older helps. I'm beginning to realize on a gut level that I have no
idea what happens next. Some days that's really hard. One woman and I were discussing the whole uncertainty
thing and I got rescue-y . I suggested to her that it was like being a trapeze artist, and you just let go of one
trapeze, fly through the air for a while and grab then next. She replied, ""Right. Except for a few things: you've
never seen a trapeze before, you're blind, all of your enemies are watching, your hair's on fire and you're naked.""
Point taken. Identification with the client: ""W e are not cut from dif ferent cloth, but from the same cloth."" This, to
me, is per haps the most pr ecious thing about doing ACT. Being trained in the psychodynamic camp, I always felt
like a fraud. I knew that I wasn't necessarily stronger or more psychologically healthy , but the work seemed to
need me to put on my therapist suit and pretend that I was. So the client would be wearing their client suit and I'd
be wearing my therapist suit and we'd sit in the room and pretend not to notice when the suits slipped. Not as
much fun as you might imagine. Normal r eassurance vs. soft r eassurance . How I make this distinction is this-
normal reassurance has the flavor of the tense pat on the back and the underlying desire for them to stop talking.
""It will be all right,"" is usually for me. I can feel the tenseness in my face when I'm being normally reassuring,
and I can find myself wandering, thinking about grocery shopping and whatnot. When I'm doing soft
reassurance, I'm often more uncomfortable, tending to see how close their suf fering is to mine and I'm riveted. I
can't hold anything else, just the awareness of how hard it is sometimes to be human. Often, I get teary ,
especially when I get in touch with the amazing courage it takes for some of my clients to just get out of bed in
the morning. Self-disclosur e: An essential aspect of developing a human r elationship . Where I still struggle is
with the workability of the self- disclosure. If I'm having a terrible day , I think the client can tell, but they're
paying me to be present for them, although some of them would love to caretake me in the session, if only to
avoid their stuf f. It's messy , this edge, and I like precision. But I think the messiness is where the life is. Perhaps.
Therapeutic Use of Spirituality . ""A view of the world that recognizes a transcendent quality to human
experience, acknowledges the universal aspects of the human condition, and respects the client's values and
choices. "" Stepping back from a personal struggle and examining it openly and non-defensively . Easier said than
done. This is where the observer exercise comes in, for me. I've had the experience of transcendence with this
exercise, and clients had described the same. When they can dip into that open hearted space and observe
themselves from there, their faces and bodies soften. It's really wonderful to watch. This observer position is the
most fluid position I can take in the session as well. That being said, it takes repeated ef fort and intention to
come to this place. But when someone--myself or client--has had the experience of this observer self, they know
that it's possible. There's a “there there” for them, if you will. Until the experience happens, there's no there for
them to go to. At least as I see it. Radical respect: ""There is no right of wrong way to live one's life. There are
only consequences that follow from specific human behaviors."" Another quote I've stolen from a client. ""So the
way I look at it, there's six billion and counting humans on the planet. There's probably not one right way to be a
human being, so my job is to find the way I want to be a human being and choose things that get me there."" In
my experience, this defining of valued direction tends to evolve over time. Not many of the people I work with
can immediately describe what matters to them. We tend to do successive approximation, and look for a non-
verbal response, sort of an aha experience. Values work is the part of ACT  I struggle with the most. Clinical use
of humor and irreverence: ""The therapist's irreverence comes from an appreciation of the craziness and verbal
entanglements that surround human living."" It seems to me that this can backfire if I'm not in radical respect.
Radical respect seems to infuse all of the work with a client from the ACT  perspective. RR for their values, RR
for their history , RR for their choices. RR for how they show up in the room. Is RR the same as acceptance? It's
great when the client begins using humor and irreverence with their stuf f. Another steal: Client's doing a lot of
reason giving, catches themselves and says, ""Anyway , that's my story and I'm sticking with it."" Then laughs.
Very cool stuf f.

Negative leverage points in ACT  ACT is not an intellectual exer cise Overemphasizing verbal content and trying
to convince clients is the antithesis of an ef fective ACT  relationship. Better: - be ""compassionately
confrontational"" - no more than 20% of the session involving explaining ACT  principles - use metaphors and
exercises Modeling a lack of acceptance  This is especially dif ficult with more disturbed clients (suicidality , self-2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 64/118
mutilation, bizarre behaviors,...) Ways of nonacceptance: - selective reinforcement of socially desirable thoughts
& behavior , while ignoring or disputing negatively evaluated experiences - using the language of choice in a
socially coercive way: ""It's your choice, and you're not making it!"" - ""Where did you learn that way of thinking?""
Heavy emphasis on history & reason giving Solution: acknowledge it & let go of it. Excessive focus on
emotional pr ocessing  Misconception: clients should ""get in touch with their feelings"". This is true only insofar as
avoidance blocks them taking a committed direction in life. No emotional rediscovery for it's own sake. This is
the most seductive error . Solution: come back to active exercises linked to values and behavior change.
Countertransfer ence There will be issues that are as salient for the therapist as for the client. Resulting in: topic
avoidance, advice giving, excessive reliance on personal experience. Solution: self-acceptance for the therapist •
The therapeutic relationship: strong, open accepting, mutual, respectful, loving. It's not an end purpose per se. •
ACT  in context - Don't ""believe"" a word in this book - Important (dif ferent from many other clinical traditions):
link with experimental research - ""Are we using language or is language using us?"" - It's our job to try to
establish & support cultural practices inside & outside psychotherapy that ameliorate these destructive processes
in a socially broader way (e.g. acceptance & cognitive defusion). Psychotherapy sometimes undermines valuable
existing traditions (spiritual & non-rigid, non-punitive religious traditions). THE END Comments :
some useful rules are given (esp. for beginners): no more than 20% explanation, back to exercise, ...
excessive focus on emotional processing: I was exactly doing this the very moment I read this piece. Back
to values and behavior!
remaining questions: what about clients not seeking help, but needing it (involuntary treatment); how to
integrate RFT  with other problems (not having to do with avoidance): impulsivity , aggression, ...

cliniques et personnels pour le praticien. La thérapie d’acceptation et d’engagement (ACT ,
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) propose des stratégies thérapeutiques originales et
efficaces pour améliorer la qualité de vie des gens souf frant de cette problématique.
Son objectif n’est pas de modifier les symptômes, mais de faire évoluer le rapport du patient à
leur égard, de la lutte vers l’acceptation active de la douleur , et l’engagement dans des
activités en cohérence avec ses valeurs personnelles.

Darwin nous a appris comment l’évolution avait façonné notre espèce. Mais sa théorie peut
aussi être utile à chacun d’entre nous au quotidien !
Cet ouvrage explique comment les mécanismes naturels qui ont fait leur preuve pour l’espèce
humaine peuvent aider chacun de nous à évoluer dans sa vie : nous pouvons favoriser une
sélection de nos comportements, et ne plus laisser le hasard gérer notre destin.
Il propose de nombreux outils pratiques fondés sur la thérapie d’acceptation et d’engagement
et les thérapies cognitives et comportementales : dépasser les obstacles au changement, créer
de la variation, développer sa curiosité au monde, mais aussi, quand il le faut, accepter les
choses comme elles viennent, ne rien changer , cesser de vouloir contrôler l’incontrôlable….
Un « darwinisme personnel » pour faciliter votre propre évolution !
This book presents a selectionist approach of behaviors. It proposes advice and tools to
commit in direction of values and to walk through acceptance, by using concepts from

Acceptance and Values-Based Action in Chr onic Pain: A Study of Treatment Effectiveness and Pr ocess
Cognitive-behavioral approaches to pain management have an established record of empirical support. However ,
as true with other behavioral problems, the mechanism by which improvement occurred is inconsistent with the
theoretical underpinnings of CBT . In a recent paper , Vowles and McCracken add to their ongoing line of research
in acceptance-based approaches to the treatment of chronic pain. In their paper , they present their findings of an
inter-disciplinary treatment program based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy , with a focus on acceptance
and values-based action. One-hundred seventy-one participants completed the program which consisted of 3 to 4
weeks of inpatient treatment for about 30 hours per week. Participants improved across almost all domains,
including pain, depression, pain-related anxiety , disability , medical visits, work status, and physical performance,
and ef fect sizes for these improvements were medium to lar ge. Analysis of reliable change revealed that 75.4%
of participants improved in at least one key domain assessed. In contrast with CBT -based approaches to pain
management, improvements across these domains were associated with ACT's proposed mechanisms of action,
namely , acceptance of pain and values-based action. The authors conclude that these findings provide support for
the ACT  model of treatment for chronic pain, and the processes associated with improvement – acceptance and
values-based action.

Rule-Governed Behavior  and Psychological Pr oblems  Humans, uniquely among animals, can come to
understand and respond to linguistic rules, both ef fective ones and not so ef fective ones. The ef fective ones help
us to learn and adapt to our environment. The inef fective ones can cause maladaptive behavior and diminish our
lives considerably . This paper presents a functional analysis of patterns of rule-governed behavior (RGB) and
shows how rules can contribute to psychopathology . Rules have been described as antecedent stimuli that alter
the functions of stimuli in our environment. They allow us to respond to that environment in complex and
efficacious ways. But what are rules? Relational Frame theory suggests that we humans learn to respond in
accordance with abstract relational patterns based on cues (e.g., SAME). Rules are essentially combinations of2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 88/118
cues that specify particular relations between environmental stimuli and between environment and behavior and
thus allow us to respond in new ways (‘transformation of function’). The paper describes three functional
patterns of RGB. These are pliance, tracking and augmental rule following. Pliance is RGB under the control of
a history of socially mediated reinforcement for coordination between behavior and antecedent verbal stimuli
(rules). A typical example might be a child obeying the rule ‘Don’ t touch my laptop’  because their parent has
given them this rule and because their parent has previously provided consequences for following or not
following rules. Tracking is RGB under the control of a history of coordination between the rule and the way the
environment is arranged independently of the rule. An example might be a child obeying the parental rule ‘Eat
your breakfast because it will give you more ener gy’ because in the past the child has experienced the ef fect of
other rules that have been accurate in their description of the environment. If this rule also shows coordination
(i.e., the child finds an increase in ener gy when they eat breakfast), then this will further strengthen tracking
behavior . Augmenting is RGB due to relational networks that alter the degree to which events function as
consequences. The example given is ‘Eat your vegetables to be a big strong boy’. If this rule makes vegetable
eating more reinforcing then it might be described as augmenting. Each of these patterns has its advantages and
its disadvantages, including maladaptive behavior . It’s useful for children to learn pliance since this allows them
to acquire useful adaptive habits, but doing things just because one is told to can make one insensitive to one’ s
environment. Tracking allows independence from social whim, but tracking can also lead to inef fective behavior;
for example, tracking short term reinforcement can mean one misses longer term reinforcement. Augmenting is
the most advanced form of rule governed behavior and as such it can interact with and reinforce either of the
other two functional patterns resulting in strongly adaptive or maladaptive patterns. Experiential avoidance can
be a product of the latter while valuing, an important part of the antidote to EA, is an example of the former .
Törneke, Luciano and Valdivia (2008) have provided an excellent description of RGB and its relationship to
psychopathology .

Brief Review: A Parametric Study of Cognitive Defusion and Believability  The ef fects of the “Milk, milk,
milk” exercise are dependent upon the length of the intervention: Reducing distress in respect to private events
has been a major emphasis of traditional behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapies. The inclusion of
mindfulness interventions in some contemporary therapies like ACT  has shifted this focus from distress
reduction to changing the behavior regulatory functions of distressing private events. One means of examining
this change is by asking clients about the believability of their thoughts. Defusion interventions represent ef forts
to disrupt this behavior regulation, and the “milk, milk, milk” exercise is the intervention examined in this
article. Two studies examined the ef fect of this exercise on the emotional discomfort and believability of a
negative, self-relevant word identified by the participant as suf ficiently problematic. Each study varied the
amount of time spent repeating the word – 0, 3, or 20 seconds in study 1 and 1, 10, or 30 seconds in study 2. A
rationale for the procedure and training with the word “milk” was provided before each intervention. Results
showed that emotional distress reduced significantly within 3-10 seconds, while believability reduced
significantly only after 20-30 seconds. The dif ference in timing for these reductions suggests that discomfort and
believability are functionally distinct behaviors. The authors suggest extending defusion exercises until the
believability of thoughts, rather than just emotional distress, diminishes.

Brief Review: Relational Frame Theory and Social Categorization  The Matching-to-Sample procedure can
transform the functions of arbitrary stimuli in the Implicit Associations Test: This study examined the acquisition
of obesity stigma to arbitrary stimuli. More specifically , the matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure was used to
provide relational conditioning suf ficient to generate a transformation of stimulus functions for stigma to images2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

of either horizontal or vertical lines. The Implicit Associations Test (IA T) was used to detect this transformation
of functions. Fifty under graduate psychology students engaged in a series of five computerized tasks: (1) an IA T
containing evaluative words and images of horizontal and vertical lines, to confirm a lack of pre-existing bias,
(2) an established IA T for detecting implicit evaluative bias toward obesity , to confirm the presence of pre-
existing bias, (3) two MTS tasks providing relational conditioning suf ficient to generate the transfer of positive
and negative evaluative functions to images of horizontal and vertical lines, (4) the same IA T used in step 1, to
assess for the acquisition of bias, and (5) the same IA T used in step 2. Results confirmed no pre-existing bias at
time 1, a lar ge and significant predicted bias at time 2, and a small and significant predicted bias at time 4. The
results of this study are discussed in respect to an RFT  account of the development of stigma and social
categorization and contrasted with a more mainstream, cognitive account known as the Social Knowledge
Structure.

ACT  ARTICLES AND RELA TED TOPICS
Acceptance and commitment training reduces prejudice and promotes diversity-oriented behaviors in college
students
Despite increased ef forts at promoting diversity in recent years, prejudice continues to result in diminished
quality of life for ethnic, racial and religious minorities across numerous life domains. Interventions designed to
reduce prejudice have been moderately successful with short-term improvements, but do not seem to promote
sustained equitable attitudes and behavior . In fact, in some instances, the interventions actually result in an
increased bias. ACT  may be particularly applicable to prejudice due to its focus on intransigent and dif ficult
cognitions. Luoma and Hayes compared a brief ACT  Training protocol to an education-based prejudice
awareness training intervention for reducing racial and ethnic prejudice in college students. Material was
presented to students using a counterbalanced within-group design such that the impact of each approach could
be evaluated independently . The outcome measure, developed for this study , consisted of items assessing the
following: awareness of bias; acceptance and flexibility; thought control and defusion; and positive actions.
Student responses suggest that the ACT  training produced greater reductions in prejudice across most
dimensions, and that only ACT  training promoted greater intention to engage in diversity-oriented behaviors.
Changes in these positive intentions were partially mediated by acceptance and flexibility , and defusion
processes explained more variance in positive intention outcomes than acknowledgement of bias. The authors
suggest that the combined findings of this study and a previous ACT -based study on prejudice lend preliminary
support to an ACT -RFT  based model of understanding and reducing prejudice. The findings are also consistent
with the theory underlying acceptance-based approaches stating that it is the relationship with thought rather
than the content of thought that matters. Limitations of the study include the use of an unvalidated outcome
measure, the potential self-selection bias of students who choose to enroll in a class on the psychology of racial
differences, the potential for bias of the interventionist in favor of ACT , and a short follow-up interval. Future
studies are proposed using a more intensive intervention and assessing longer -term outcomes. Given the need for
empirically supported approaches to address prejudice, the findings of the current study are promising. In terms
of clinical application, the authors propose that similar processes are likely in play with regard to mental health
stigma, and that cognitive processes that promote prejudice are themselves psychologically damaging.

ACT  and CT  for anxiety and depression, a randomized controlled ef fectiveness trial
For some period of time there has been discussion and even ar gumentation between those who hold true to
cognitive models of intervention (e.g. Beckian) and acceptance models of intervention (e.g. Hayesian). Forman
and colleagues take a closer look. They explain that Cognitive Therapy (CT) has a mixed record of success in
producing theoretically-consistent mediation of treatment outcomes while Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT) has a relatively impressive, though preliminary record, of the same. Given that only a handful of studies
have directly compared these treatments and that all contained methodological shortcomings the authors
undertook that task of comparing each therapy's ability to produce mediation and positive outcomes among an
outpatient sample of college students in a well-controlled trial. Services were provided by clinical psychology
doctoral candidates working at a student counseling center . Outcome measures included self-reports of
symptoms (BDI-II, BAI, OQ-45) and self-reports of quality of life (QOLI, SLS). Two mediational measures
were administered (KIMS, AAQ). The study also included measures of treatment fidelity , therapist allegiance,
and participant expectancies of treatment. Results showed that all measures were comparable between
treatments, and that each treatment generated lar ge ef fect sizes. Mediational analyses showed that the observing
subscale of the KIMS more strongly (though nonsignificantly) predicted outcomes for CT , while the AAQ and
the acting with awareness and acceptance subscales of the KIMS more strongly (and significantly) predicted
outcomes for ACT . The authors reported that ""changes in ""observing"" and ""describing"" one's experiences were
more strongly associated with outcomes for those in the CT  group relative to those in the ACT  group, whereas2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

experiential avoidance, acting with awareness, and acceptance were more strongly associated with outcomes for
those in the ACT  group"" (p. 792). Although, the authors concluded that ""these findings support the notion that
CT and ACT  are functionally distinct from one another"" (p. 792), it was never explained why the capacity to
observe and describe one's private experiences is a fundamental component of CT  but not ACT .

RFT  ARTICLES
How does multiple-exemplar training and naming establish derived equivalence in an infant?
Stimulus equivalence at its simplest can be described as follows. Imagine I train someone in the following two
relations between physically dif ferent arbitrary stimuli: Pick stimulus B when you see stimulus A, and pick
stimulus C when you see stimulus B. If given the opportunity , a verbally able human might subsequently go on
to demonstrate further relations, without being trained to do so, including picking A when he sees B, and picking
B when he sees C (i.e., reversing the trained relations, referred to as symmetry), picking C when he sees A (i.e.,
combining the trained relations, referred to as transitivity) and picking A when he sees C (a combination of
symmetry and transitivity). This pattern of derived responses has been called stimulus equivalence, because it
appears that, suddenly and unexpectedly and without being trained to do so, the person is treating a number of
physically dif ferent stimuli as mutually substitutable for or equivalent to each other . There is growing interest in
stimulus equivalence research as only verbally able subjects seem to be able to show this pattern readily ,
suggesting a link between equivalence and language. But what is the nature of this link? How are the two
connected? The present paper discusses two theoretical approaches that claim to account for this link - Relational
Frame Theory (e.g., Hayes et al., 2001) and Naming Theory (Horne & Lowe, 1996). More importantly , however ,
the paper reports a series of experiments involving training an infant in relational responding that provide
important additional evidence pertaining to the debate between these approaches. More specifically , the results
add to evidence in favour of the RFT  account, while demonstrating a phenomenon that directly contradicts
Naming Theory . This study is a significant empirical contribution for a number of reasons (i) It demonstrates the
use of multiple exemplar training to establish generalized contextually controlled receptive mutual entailed
relational responding; (ii) it provides the youngest empirical example of coordinate (sameness) combinatorial
entailed relational responding (equivalence) ever recorded; and (iii) it provides extremely important evidence
vis-a-vis the Naming Theory / RFT  debate by providing empirical evidence that directly contradicts a core tenet
of Naming Theory while being consistent with RFT .

Can the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure be faked? First evidence says no.
The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a computer -based task for the assessment of implicit
cognitions recently devised within the theoretical framework of RFT . It is a latency-based response measure that
intends to assess the participants' existing verbal-relational networks (i.e. beliefs). It works by requiring
participants to respond as quickly and accurately as possible across trials when presented with particular
relations (among sample and tar get stimuli) that may be consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs (i.e.
relational networks). The idea is that participants will be faster when required to respond to stimulus relations
that are consistent (e.g. categorizing words like love or peace as pleasant, and words like vomit or death as
unpleasant) than to stimulus relations that are inconsistent with their verbal histories (e.g. categorizing vomit or
death as pleasant, and love or peace as unpleasant). This idea is supported by empirical evidence from several2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 92/118
recent studies. As with other implicit measures, like the Implicit Association Test (IA T), one of the strengths of
the IRAP  is that it may be less sensitive than questionnaires and other explicit measures to assess deliberate
attempts to conceal information about one's own socially sensitive attitudes. This study attempted to see to which
extent this is the case (i.e. whether the IRAP  can be faked). Three groups of participants underwent two
consecutive exposures of the IRAP  task with the same stimuli (the words pleasant and unpleasant as samples, the
words similar and opposite as response options, one set of six pleasant tar get words, and one set of six
unpleasant tar get words). Between both exposures, one group was informed about how the IRAP  works. Another
group received the same information and was told to fake the IRAP , without a specific strategy to do so. The
third group received the same information and were also provided with a strategy , namely slowing down on
consistent trials and going fast on inconsistent trials. Results showed no evidence of faking in any condition. All
groups showed an IRAP  effect in the second exposure regardless of the instructions or strategies received.
According to a post-task questionnaire, only two participants in the third group reported using the specific
strategy they had received. All in all, participants found it dif ficult to fake the IRAP , even if provided with
specific strategies. This contrasts with previous findings with the IA T, which can be successfully faked when
explicitly told how to do so. This observed resistance to deliberate attempts to fake performance renders the
IRAP  a solid procedure for the assessment of implicit cognitions.

What can RFT  add to the study of pain?
The current study focuses on an RFT  interpretation of the way that pain takes part in complex behavioural
episodes for humans. It is a theoretical/conceptual study that reviews functional-contextual approaches to the
study of private events specifically related to pain and with a special emphasis in recent research in verbal
behaviour , behaviour -behaviour relations, and transformation of psychological functions. The review is divided
into four parts. The first summarizes the philosophical assumptions of functional-contextualism and its
implications for the study of pain (e.g. the extent to which explanations of pain allow for ef fective action as the
criterion against which these explanations should be tested). The second focuses on the classical behaviour -
analytic point of view , where pain experiences have been conceptualized as private events that exert
discriminative control over subsequent behaviours (e.g. abuse of pain-killers, inactivity , social isolation, etc.).
This discriminative function (behaviour -behaviour relation) is the product of specific histories of reinforcement
along the individual's development, in direct-contingency terms. This view is illustrated with the presentation of
the contributions of Schoenfeld and, more specifically , of Fordyce. RFT  is proposed as a more comprehensive
framework for the behaviour ral study of pain, a framework where verbal (derived) histories can be included as
part of the explanation. In line with this, pain-related clinical problems are conceptualized as a form of
experiential avoidance disorder , where it is the verbal functions of pain, rather than pain itself, that limit the
individual's life (i.e. the consideration of pain as a literal barrier for engaging in valued actions). This is
described in the third part of the article. Finally , the last part of the article presents a general overview of ACT
and describes its implications for the treatment of pain-related problems.

at end of document: ACT  ARTICLES AND RELA TED TOPICS  Acceptance and pain in children.... The
literature supporting the use of cognitive-behavioral interventions for chronic pain in adults is fairly extensive.
Nevertheless, considerably less empirical support is available for psychological approaches to pain in children.
Even more limited is the literature on psychological approaches to idiopathic (of unknown cause) chronic pain in
youths. Acceptance-based approaches have been implemented into behavioral pain treatments in adults, and have
been found to be associated with better outcomes. The authors of a recent study investigated the impact of an
ACT  intervention with an exposure component for increased functioning and school attendance in 14
adolescents experiencing idiopathic chronic pain. The intervention was administered in individual therapy
sessions tailored to the individual patient, but generally followed a format that included education, ACT , and
exposure. Parents were also seen in separate sessions to provide guidance on an intervention-consistent parental
coaching role versus a caretaking role. The number of sessions varied across patients. Post-intervention data2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 94/118
revealed lar ge ef fect sizes for improvements in the primary outcomes (functioning and school attendance) in
addition to the secondary outcomes (pain intensity , pain interference, and catastrophizing). Interestingly , pain
intensity and interference decreased following this intervention despite the absence of intervention components
targeting pain reduction. Limitations of the study included lack of a control group, variability in session number
and therapeutic skills, and absence of a measure of the proposed mechanism of action (psychological flexibility).
Despite the limitations, this pilot study contributes to a nascent area of research on the treatment of chronic pain
in youths, and suggests a potential role for ACT -based interventions in this population. Read the Article:

and experiential avoidance... Trichotillomania (TTM) is estimated to be present in up to 3.4% of the population
and is associated with significant psychosocial dif ficulties. Previous research has identified several specific
cognitions and af fective states that are associated with the tendency to engage in hair pulling. A recent internet-
based study investigated the potential relevance of the stance of the TTM suf ferer towards aversive thoughts and
emotions in hair pulling severity . More than 700 individuals reporting a diagnosis of TTM completed an
anonymous online survey assessing: DSM-IV  TTM criteria; hair pulling severity , urge, behavior and
consequences; shame; self-perceived appearance; and fear of negative evaluation; and experiential avoidance. In
spite of the waning criticism of internet-based research, the sample characteristics suggest that is was similar to
those of studies completed in clinical settings, and the reported internal consistencies of the employed measures
suggested that participants provided meaningful responses. As found in previous research, hair pulling behavior
was associated with greater negative cognitions. However , in the current study , these associations were either
significantly reduced or eliminated when experiential avoidance was introduced as a mediator . Under the
premise that aversive cognitions are functionally related to hair pulling behavior , clinicians commonly tar get
thought content using a cognitive restructuring approach to TTM. However , the findings of the current study
suggest that tar geting avoidance may result in a greater degree of behavior change. Replication of this study is
needed in a clinical sample and should include longitudinal data to explore causal pathways plus a lar ger battery
of private events should be investigated. Despite the need for additional study , the findings of the current study
implicate experiential avoidance as a potentially critical factor in the understanding and treatment of TTM. Read

a mediator of relationships between cognitions and hair -pulling severity . Behavior Modification, 31 , 367-381.
__________ Preliminary findings suggest that ACT  is useful for coping with psychological distress related to
breast cancer . A recent article in the Spanish journal of psychooncology (Psicooncología) suggests that
psychological problems resulting from diagnosis, treatment, and possible sequels of breast cancer , can be
analysed as a form of an experiential avoidance disorder . The authors explored the application of an acceptance-
based psychological intervention to these problems in a Spanish sample, comparing it with a more traditional
intervention based on cognitive-control. Twelve women (ages 42 to 50) that had been diagnosed and treated for
breast cancer took part. Half of them were randomly assigned to treatment with a brief adaptation of Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy . This acceptance-based protocol focused on the clarification of personal values, the
detection and acceptance of psychological barriers to acting towards those values, and on the continued practice
of cognitive defusion through experiential exercises and metaphors. The other six women were treated with a
brief adaptation of the of ficial cognitive-behavioral program of the Spanish Association Against Cancer . This
protocol focused on analysing the relationships among disease-related thoughts, feelings, and actions, and in the
modification of those cognitions and emotions through several strategies (e.g. identification and management of
automatic dysfunctional emotional reactions, emotional ventilation techniques, breathing and relaxation
techniques for anxiety control, etc.). The general aim was to promote a sense of personal control over
problematic private events, and to encourage a positive coping style. Overt behavioral components (exposure
and activity planning) were explicitly excluded from this protocol. Both interventions were administered in eight
sessions (two initial individual sessions, five group sessions, and a final individual session), with pre- and post -
treatment assessment, and up to 12-month follow-ups. Post-treatment ef fects were similar for both conditions,
but after one year , ACT  was significantly more ef fective, with improvements in anxiety and depression scores,
quality of life scores, and af fected valued life areas. Despite the key limitation in terms of generalizability due to
the small sample size, the results are promising and these findings point to ACT  as a potentially ef fective
treatment for disease-related psychological distress in long-term medical conditions. Read the Original Article in

75-95. [Psychological treatment for coping with breast cancer . A comparative study of acceptance and cognitive-
control strategies]. __________ Can brief training for new therapists in ACT  and CBT  be ef fective? Many
psychotherapy ef fectiveness trials use experts in the therapies they are testing. In this Finnish study , the authors
wanted to first reduce this professional bias common in many head-to-head trials, by using graduate-level
therapists. They explored level of training, regardless of therapeutic intervention, required to achieve significant
psychological ef fects in treated individuals. Therapists were taught both CBT  and ACT , through a combination
of lectures, reading, and case supervision. Each therapist delivered a CBT  treatment and an ACT  treatment. The
only criteria for entry into the study was a desire for individual therapy , thus a range of diagnoses were
represented in the study population of 28. The techniques used within each model were based on a functional
analysis case formulation model, and as such there was some overlap in techniques. For example, both
interventions set treatment goals, used behavioral activation and exposure; and the treatments were problem, not
syndrome focused. Overall, ACT  showed significantly lar ger ef fect sizes at post and follow-up for symptom
improvement. Both groups showed improvements on symptom reduction, but the ACT  group was ""virtually
indistinguishable"" from community norms. CBT  showed more rapid improvement in self-confidence than ACT ,
and ACT  improved acceptance of private experience more than CBT . When controlling for self-confidence,
acceptance remained a significant predictor of improved outcome on the SCL-90 at both post and follow-up
assessment. There were no dif ferences between the two on client satisfaction or client willingness to recommend
the therapy . There were also no dif ferences post treatment in the therapist comfort with therapy or how much
they felt they had helped their clients, although therapists reported more discomfort and confusion about learning
and delivering ACT . So the answer is, yes. Brief training in either ACT  or CBT  with novice therapists produced
moderately good psychological ef fects. The authors emphasize in their discussion of the limitations that this was
not an ef fectiveness trail comparing the two therapies, but rather an ef fectiveness trial focusing on the issues of
brief training and competency . Read the Article: Lappalainen, R., Lehtonen, T., & Skarp, E. (2007). The impact

Behavior Modification, 31 (4), 488-51 1. __________ Do we need to challenge thoughts in CBT? The title says it
all. In this review of CBT  component analyses, the authors investigate the 'three anomalies of CBT' put forth by
Steve Hayes in a previous paper . These are that component analyses do not show added value of cognitive
interventions; that there is often early rapid improvement in CBT  prior to cognitive intervention; and that
changes in cognitive mediators (thoughts/beliefs) don't seem to precede symptom changes. The authors found 13
component analysis for Cognitive Therapy (CT) in the treatment of depression and anxiety , published since 1980
in English. There were no significant dif ferences between conditions that tar geted cognitive process only or
primarily and comparison groups that often included behavioral activation (BA). In many cases, BA  was found
to be as ef fective as CT  and/or Automatic Thought (A T) interventions. To quote the authors, ""the case at issue is
not that CT  performed poorly , but that BA  performed so well."" They discussed preliminary findings from a long-
term lar ge-scale project that has been presented at conferences (but not yet published) in which BA  performed as
well as antidepressant medication, and that both were superior to CT . For anxiety disorders, cognitive
interventions have not been found to be more ef fective than disorder -specific exposure techniques. In addressing
the second anomaly the authors concluded that that early responding has insuf ficient evidence to support CT .
And as for the third, it appears that there is insuf ficient evidence to support cognitive mediation as a mechanism
of change in therapy . The authors conclude that, almost without exception, among component analysis studies,
there was no dif ference in ef fectiveness between the behavioral and cognitive components of CBT . The cognitive
interventions appeared to add no additional value to behavioral interventions. The authors called CT  theorists
and researchers to task, requesting further investigation of the fundamental tenets of CT  therapy . Read the

therapy? Clinical Psychology Review , 27(2),173-187. RFT  ARTICLES  Training more-than/less-than relations
can facilitate derived comparative relations in young children ... One critical assumption in RFT  is that relating
events is operant behavior . This is a challenge to demonstrate empirically , since relating is theorized to develop
early in life. Examining relatively complex relations among older , more manageable subjects is one means of
avoiding certain dif ficulties in this analysis. This study was conducted with four normally functioning females
between four and five years old. The design of the study involved a multiple baseline across participants in
groups of two. Stimuli were paper slips displaying arbitrary pictures. Sessions were conducted between 1 and 3
times weekly , each lasting between 40 and 60 minutes. Participants required between 2 and 6 months to
complete the study . All participants displayed deficiencies in more-than/less-than relating before training and
demonstrated derived performances after suf ficient training. Two of the four participants required non-arbitrary2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

training among dif fering stacks of pennies before demonstrating criterion responding in training with arbitrary
stimuli. In summary , these results provide evidence supporting the contention that relating events is an operant
class, and that a repertoire of relating among non-arbitrary events may be a prerequisite for arbitrarily applicable
derived relational responding. Read the Article (available for download on the ACBS website): Berens, N. M., &
Hayes, S. C. (2007). Arbitrarily applicable comparative relations: Experimental evidence for a relational operant.
Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 40 , 45-71. __________ Combinatorial entailment in young children is
facilitated by multiple exemplar training... RFT  is built on the basic tenet that relating events is a generalized
operant. In other words, the ability to derive relations among arbitrary stimuli develops from explicit training
with multiple exemplars in early life. Consistent with this assumption, a former study found that derived
symmetrical relations among the majority of a sample of 4-5 year old children were contingent upon explicit
training with multiple exemplars. The current work contains two studies, each incorporating a multiple baseline
design. Participants were two female and two male children between the ages of 4:6 and 4:10 years/months. The
first study examined the repertoire for symmetrical relations using the procedures of the former study .
Participants received conditional discrimination training for an action (e.g., clapping, waving) given an object
(e.g., doll, truck). Subsequently they were tested for symmetrical relations between the action and the object. All
children successfully derived symmetrical relations without encountering exemplar training. The second study
examined for equivalence relations, building upon the training provided in the first study . A new set of actions
(e.g., touching forehead, touching shoulder) were trained in respect to the objects. Subsequently the children
were tested for equivalence relations between the actions trained in the first study and the new actions. Three of
the four children required exemplar training for equivalence before demonstrating derived equivalence. These
results support the developmental trajectory hypothesized in RFT , and suggest a means of remediation for
delayed or absent relational abilities. Read the Article: Gomez, S., Lopez, F ., Martin, C. B., Barnes-Holmes, Y.,
& Barnes-Holmes, D. (2007). Exemplar training and a derived transformation of functions in accordance with
symmetry and equivalence. Psychological Recor d, 57 , 273-294. __________ RFT  and Perspective-taking in
children with high-functioning autistic spectrum disorder . The current research involves using a test of
perspective taking based on the Relational Frame Theory to (i) compare normally developing children and
autistic children and (ii) demonstrate how perspective taking skills may be trained when they are deficient.
According to RFT , language essentially involves relating things in accordance with particular learned patterns
referred to as relational frames. Perspective taking is one specific pattern of relating or 'relational framing' in
which the relating depends on the perspective of the person who is doing the relating. According to RFT , there
are three core relational patterns or frames involved in perspective taking: I-YOU, HERE-THERE and NOW -
THEN. This article reports on two experiments focusing on perspective taking in normal and autistic subjects. In
the first experiment they use an RFT -based test of perspective taking to compare two groups of 9 children each.
One of these groups is composed of normally developing children while the other is composed of high
functioning autistic children. Results from this first experiment were that (i) there was a significant dif ference
between the means scores for the normal and autistic groups of children on both the clinical tests; (ii) across both
groups, most errors in the perspective taking test were made on reversed relations and there was a significant
difference between performance on the simple and reversed level tasks; (iii) the two groups - normally
developing and autistic - dif fered significantly as regards to performance on the reversed relations tasks but not
as regards to performance on either of other two task types; (iv) there was a correlation across all subjects
between performance on the NOW -THEN reversed relations task and Daily Living Skills scores. The researchers
suggest that despite a small sample size, the results provide support for the RFT  account of perspective taking as
deictic relational responding in that autistic children did perform more poorly than the normally developing
children in the relational perspective-taking tasks provided. They performed significantly more poorly in the
reversed relational tasks than in the simple tasks. They did not perform significantly more poorly in the double
reversed relational tasks than in the simple tasks. However , as the researchers point out, this may be because
these tasks may be answered correctly without necessarily responding appropriately in accordance with deictic
relations. In the second experiment, the researchers used the RFT  tasks employed in Experiment 1 combined
with appropriate feedback (cartoon animations for correct responses) to train up perspective taking ability in two
of the children from the normally developing group from the first experiment. The results showed that the
relational pattern involved in perspective taking could indeed be trained up as RFT  would predict. They suggest
that this implies that the RFT  account of perspective taking is a useful one, and that RFT -based perspective
taking tasks such as those used in the current experiments may be used in future work to train up perspective
taking in autistic children. Read the Article: Rehfeldt, R.A., Dillen, J.E., & Ziomek, M.M.(2007) Assessing2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

ACT with Special Populations or in Specific Settings
ACT  with Special Populations or in Specific Settings
ACT  is a general model  of the language and cognition processes involved in reducing psychological suf fering
and promoting human well-being. As such, it is not a specific set of techniques. Any ACT  intervention is an
instance of a general psychological strategy which is designed to be flexibly applied. ACT  can be applied in
short interventions done in minutes or hours, as well as in interventions which take many sessions. ACT  can be
used in groups, individual sessions, classroom settings, couples therapy , bibliotherapy , workplace trainings, and
much more. Be sure to check out our collection of ACT  treatment protocols  and list of books for Specific
Populations .

The third generation of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been defined this way:
Grounded in an empirical, principle-focused appr oach, the thir d wave of behavioral and cognitive
therapy is particularly sensitive to the context and functions of psychological phenomena, not just
their form, and thus tends to emphasize contextual and experiential change strategies in addition to
more direct and didactic ones. These tr eatments tend to seek the construction of br oad, flexible and
effective r epertoir es over an eliminative appr oach to narr owly defined pr oblems, and to emphasize
the relevance of the issues they examine for clinicians as well as clients. The thir d wave
reformulates and synthesizes pr evious generations of behavioral and cognitive therapy and carries
them forwar d into questions, issues, and domains pr eviously addr essed primarily by other
traditions, in hopes of impr oving both understanding and outcomes.  (Hayes, 2004 )
The most unique characteristic of the third wave interventions is the degree of emphasis on contextual and
experiential change strategies, including acceptance, defusion, mindfulness, relationship, values, emotional
deepening, contact with the present moment, and the like. The purpose of experiential and contextual strategies
of this kind is to rapidly alter the function of problematic psychological events, even if their form or frequency
does not change or changes only slowly . Mindfulness-based and acceptance technologies show that focus quite
clearly . For example, Segal, Teasdale, and Williams (2004) state: “Unlike CBT , there is little emphasis in MBCT
on changing the content of thoughts; rather , the emphasis is on changing awareness of and relationship to
thoughts.”
It is worth noting that this step is being taken both by techniques that are quite behavior analytic and thus
philosophically contextualistic in their rationalization (e.g., Behavioral Activation, ICBT , DBT , ACT , FAP), and
by techniques that are quite cognitive in their rationalization (e.g., MBCT , Metacognition).
This is important, because it means that the mainstream itself is changing and there are new opportunities for
connection and communication across old boundaries. In a kind of dialectical synthesis of a previous thesis and
antithesis, the new wave therapies seem to be healing old wounds and divisions between behavioral and
cognitive perspectives. Evidence for this view can be found in the syner gies between technologies across of the
spectrum of third wave interventions, and in the ways that each of these new approaches has breadth across these
divisions regardless of its home of origin. The third wave interventions are not a rejection of the first and second
waves of behavioral and cognitive therapy so much as a transformation of these earlier phases into a new ,2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

broader , more interconnected form. Thus, while the implications may be revolutionary , the processes giving rise
to these developments are evolutionary – as might be expected in an explicitly empirical tradition.

What characterizes the so-called third wave behavior therapies?
”Grounded in an empirical, principle-focused approach, the third wave of behavioral and cognitive therapy is
particularly sensitive to the context and functions of psychological phenomena, not just their form, and thus
tends to emphasize contextual and experiential change strategies in addition to more direct and didactic ones.
These treatments tend to seek the construction of broad, flexible and ef fective repertoires over an eliminative

as well as clients. The third wave reformulates and synthesizes previous generations of behavioral and cognitive
therapy and carries them forward into questions, issues, and domains previously addressed primarily by other
traditions, in hopes of improving both understanding and outcomes.” (quote from  Hayes, 2004).
These are very broad characterizations and there is no clear dividing line between various historical aspects of
the behavior therapy tradition.

How does Relational Frame Theory (RFT) relate to traditional CBT-theories?
How does Relational Frame Theory (RFT) relate to traditional CBT -theories?
That question is a huge one. RF T seeks a broad understanding of cognition. In the long run it could be more important
than ACT because if it works the whole of psy chology could change.
RFT is dev elopmental, contextual, and beha vioral. It giv es you ideas about what to change to mak e things happen. It is
so basic that it goes all the w ay down to animal beha vior and human infants; and y et so broad in scope that it has
clear implications for our understanding of social processes or such human activities as religion.
We have nev er had an empirically adequate beha vioral, contextual account of cognition. Now we ha ve at least the
beginnings of one and it seems to be br aking down the artificial barriers between cognitiv e and beha vioral science.
The theories underlying CB T and CT are not lik e that. They ha ve relativ ely low scope and they emerged t ypically from
clinical concerns. They do not pretend to be the functional equiv alent in cognition for what “beha vioral principles” are in
non-verbal beha vior.2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

You ha ve to be impressed with what the tr aditional beha vior ther apists were able to do with tr aditional beha vioral

ACT, evolutionary biology and severe mental illness
ACT , evolutionary biology and severe mental illness
Originally submitted by user dixonph on 7/30/2014:
Edward Hagen's paper: Delusions as Exploitative Behavior
http://bit.ly/1ppVlnu echoes themes of ACT  theorists. ACT  is held by the founders as a possible aid for even
severe psychotic disorders. Contextual behavior theory is not mentioned as such in Hagen's paper . I don't know
if Hagen is involved with mental illness treatments, or ACT  specifically . The paper seems to be very much in
line with ACT  principles. That is why I mention it here. I see a connection.
If even severe mental illness is an evolutionary adaptive survival mechanism manifested as a result of a failed
social context, then how can ACT  help reintegrate the modern suf ferer into more successful social connections?
Can there be communities where ACT  functions to create an experience of acceptance and support for suf ferers
even outside the therapeutic setting?
I am looking to see if Edward Hagen is involved with ACBS/ACT . His paper states that he believes anti-
psychotic medication will not really help someone with what is called delusional disorder (semi-plausible
delusions, continued day to day routine functioning), which is distinct from the bizarre delusions of
schizophrenia. He also mentions the harmful side ef fects of the medications.
I am interested in the potential for ACT  in supportive community for mental health suf ferers.
Any known ef forts among ACT  practioners?

Differ ences/Similarities between ACT/DBT
Differences/Similarities between ACT/DBT
ACT and DB T could be considered  sister/brother technologies . Both ha ve been described as part of the ""third w ave""
of cognitiv e-beha vioral ther apies, which also includes ther apies such as mindfulness-based cognitiv e ther apy and
integr ative beha vioral couples ther apy (and potentially the new modern beha vior analytic form of beha vioral
activitation b y the deceased Jacobson and colleagues that seems to be outperforming cognitiv e ther apy for depression
in two trials). This new set of ther apies, all of which ha ve a commitment to empirical ev aluation and science, tend to
differ in important w ays from tr aditional CB T. For example, the third w ave tends to pa y more attention to secondary
change in the area of thoughts and feelings. T raditional CB T tries to help people directly change thoughts and feelings,
sort of an in- with-the-good out -with-the-bad approach to cognitiv e and emotional content. These third w ave
approaches focus on helping people to change their relationship to these priv ate experiences, r ather than trying to
change the form, situational sensitivit y, or content of these experiences. Emphasis then tends to turn to being effectiv e
in one's life and a way from working to feel GOOD . Another w ay to put this is that these ther apies tend to help people
learn how to FEEL good, r ather than to try to feel GOOD . Anyways, there are papers written about this new set of
therapies and their similarities and differences for those who w ant more info .2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT

Here's a little about what I see as  differences/similiarities between DBT and ACT,  with the disclaimer that I am
far from an expert on DB T. DBT and ACT both emerge from a beha vioral tradition. Both share the similarit y of
emphasizing acceptance, mindfulness, and effectiv eness of action. In at least those domains they are quite similar . In
terms of the theory that underlies them, they are quite different. ACT is closely tied to a modern beha vior analytic
theory of language and cognition called R elational Fr ame Theory (RF T), which underlies the approach, and also to
traditional beha vior analytic principles such as reinforcement. The first clinical trials on ACT were published sev eral
years before DB T (in 1985-86 with depression), but then Stev e Hayes decided that ACT needed a firmer theoretical
foundation and this lead to about 15 y ears of research and doz ens of studies on RF T before the next application of RF T
(an ACT clinical trial on psy chosis) w as published in 1999. My experience with DB T is that its focus has been on
developing a technology that is pr actical, pr agmatic, and manualiz ed, with less of an emphasis on dev eloping a
comprehensiv e theory of human beha vior. ACT is v ery closely tied to the broader tr adition of beha vior analysis and
could be considered a form of clinical beha vior analysis while DB T seems to be more closely tied to tr aditional beha vior
therapy.
In terms of  overlap in specific techniques  between ACT and DB T, the o verlap appears limited. There seems to be
very little o verlap in terms of the specific techniques, ex ercises, and metaphors used in session (with the ex ception of
gener al mindfulness ex ercises).
In terms of the  evidence base,  DBT undoubtedly has a stronger evidence with more replication in the more limited
areas that it has been tested (e.g. , parasuicidalit y/substance abuse), while ACT has been examined in a wider v ariety
of clinical trials, with less replication, with more disorders (e.g. , chronic pain, substance abuse, depression, workplace
settings, anxiet y, and a doz en or so other), probably due to the broader scope of its underlying theory .

depth. By studying the current and historical context in which behavior evolves, behavior analysts strive to
develop analytic concepts and rules that are useful for predicting and changing behavior in a variety of settings.
The most well-established behavioral principles of this sort are those related to classical and operant
conditioning, such as B. F . Skinner's principles of reinforcement. The core analytic unit of behavior analysis is
the operant (or multiterm contingency). An operant analysis defines behavior in terms of its relation to
antecedent events and consequences, and learning is understood to be a function of the inherent interdependence
between these features. This contextual approach to studying behavior has resulted in a robust science with many
powerful applications in nearly every area of human endeavor . Behavior analysis is supported by a philosophy of
science known as functional contextualism. See the Association for Behavior Analysis
(www .abainternational.or g) and the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies (www .behavior .org) for more

coordination
The frame of coordination is perhaps the most common type of relational responding. It incorporates the relation
of identity , sameness, or similarity . This relational frame is probably the first to be abstracted suf ficiently to
enable its application to become arbitrary , in part because it is the only relation in which derived and trained
relations are the same, regardless of the number of stimuli that participate in relational networks consisting
purely of this response frame. Naming is an example of the frame of coordination at its simplest.

deictic frames
deictic frames
Deictic relations specify a relation in terms of the perspective of the speaker such as left/right; I/you (and all of
its correlates, such as ""mine""; here/there; and now/then. Some relations may or may not be deictic, such as
front/back or above/below , depending on the perspective applied. For example, the sentence ""The back door of
my house is in front of me""  contains both a spatial and deictic form of ""front/back.""  Deictic relations seem to
be a particularly important family of relational frames  that may be critical for perspective-taking. An example is
the three frames of I and YOU, HERE and THERE, and NOW  and THEN. These frames are unlike the others
mentioned previously in that they do not appear to have any formal or nonarbitrary counterparts. Coordination,
for instance, is based on formal identity or sameness, and ""bigger than"" is based on relative size. In contrast,
frames that depend on perspective cannot be traced to formal dimensions in the environment at all; instead, the
relationship between the individual and other events serves as the constant variable upon which these frames are
based.

distinction
distinction
The frame of distinction also involves responding to one event in terms of the lack of a frame of coordination
with another , typically also along a particular dimension. Like a frame of opposition, this frame implies that
responses to one event are unlikely to be appropriate in the case of the other , but unlike opposition, the nature of
an appropriate response is typically not defined. If I am told only , for example, ""this is not warm water ,"" I do not
know whether the water is ice cold or boiling hot. When frames of distinction are combined, the combinatorially
entailed relation is weak. For example, without additional disambiguating information, if two events are dif ferent
than a third event, I do not know the relation between these two beyond the fact of their shared distinction.

frames is limited only by the creativity of the social/verbal community that trains them. Thus the foregoing list is
to some degree tentative. For example, TIME and CAUSALITY  can be thought of as one or two types of

to the goals of RFT . Thus, while the generic concept of a relational frame is foundational to RFT , the concept of
any particular relational frame is not. The purpose in constructing a list of frames is to provide a set of

subsequent empirical analyses are conducted. To see some brief examples of common families of relational

frames of comparison
frames of comparison
The family of comparative relational frames  is involved whenever one event is responded to in terms of a
quantitative or qualitative relation along a specified dimension with another event. Many specific subtypes of
comparison exist (e.g., bigger/smaller , faster/slower , better/worse). Although each subtype may require its own
history , the family resemblance may allow the more rapid learning of successive members. The dif ferent
members of this family of relations are defined in part by the dimensions along which the relation applies (e.g.,
size; attractiveness; speed). Comparative frames may be made more specific by quantification of the dimension
along which a comparative relation is made. For example, the statement ""A  is twice as fast as B and B is twice as
fast as C"" allows a precise specification of the relation within all three pairs of elements in the network.

frames of coordination
The frame of coordination is perhaps the most common type of relational responding. It incorporates the relation
of identity , sameness, or similarity . This relational frame is probably the first to be abstracted suf ficiently to
enable its application to become arbitrary , in part because it is the only relation in which derived and trained
relations are the same, regardless of the number of stimuli that participate in relational networks consisting
purely of this response frame. Naming is an example of the frame of coordination at its simplest.

frames of opposition
frames of opposition
Opposition is another early relational frame . In natural language use, this kind of relational responding  involves
an abstracted dimension along which events can be ordered and distinguished in equal ways from a reference
point. Along the verbally abstracted dimension of temperature, for example, cool is the opposite of warm, and
cold is the opposite of hot. The specific relational frame of opposition typically (but not necessarily) implicates
the relevant dimension (e.g., ""pretty is the opposite of ugly"" is relevant to appearance). Opposition  should
normally emer ge after coordination  because the combinatorially entailed relation in frames of opposition
includes frames of coordination (e.g., if hot is the opposite of freezing and cold is the opposite of hot, then cold
is the same as freezing).

A specific form of contextualism with the a priori analytic goals of the prediction-and-influence of behavioral
events, with precision, scope, and depth. ""Prediction-and-influence"" is hyphenated here to emphasize its
fundamental inseverability in functional contextualism, even though in practical terms it is possible only to reach

generalized operant
Operants are purely functional units of analysis, or ganized by their common antecedent, consequential, and
motivational sources of control. However , because topographical and functional classes of behavior -environment
interactions often overlap, operants are sometimes thought of in topographical terms. The word ""generalized"" (or
similar terms, such as ""purely functional"" or ""overarching"") is used to emphasize that this particular operant is
not usefully thought of in topographical terms.

hierarchial frames
Hierarchical relations or hierarchical class memberships have the same diode-like quality of frames of
comparison, but the combinatorially entailed relations dif fer because the hierarchical relation itself is the basis
for a frame of coordination . For example, if Tom is the father of Simon and Jane, then Simon and Jane are
known to be siblings. If Tom is taller than both Simon and Jane, however , the relative heights of Simon and Jane
are unknown. Hierarchical relations are essential to many forms of verbal abstraction.

The Three Earliest ACT Protocols
The Three Earliest ACT  Protocols
Sleuthing exactly when the first ACT  protocols were written is tricky due to the passage of time, and the fact that
computers did not exist so duplicate records meant carbon paper copies on onion skin kept in files and packed in
cardboard boxes as moves occurred or new jobs were secured. Thus the reasoning for dating is included below .
The first ACT  protocol was likely written by Steve Hayes in late Spring of 1981. At that time the name was
""Comprehensive Distancing"". An attachment to this page contains that very first protocol (""1981 Big D Manual
S C Hayes"") which is only 3 pages long. But its clear from the ""manual"" (an outline really) that the students
knew the metaphors and exercises. Steve thinks his ""night on the carpet"" (www .bit.ly/StevesFirstTED) was
during the 1980-81 winter break and that he came back to the lab ready to push hard on studying what he had
experienced. He thinks he remembers conducting a workshop in the lab soon after and the ""manual"" was written
after that in the 1981 Spring semester .
The next protocol was written soon after in 1981. Here is how we know that: the study was an analogue study on
pain tolerance and it was presented at the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy (now AABT) in
1982: 
Hayes, S. C., Korn, Z., Zettle, R. D., Rosenfarb, I., & Cooper , L. (November 1982). Rule‑governed behavior and
cognitive behavior therapy: The effects of compr ehensive cognitive distancing on pain tolerance.  Paper
presented at the meeting of the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy , Los Angeles. 
That means the study was finished by about March of 1982 so it could be submitted. 
But Rob Zettle (Steve Hayes's first doctoral student) thinks he likely used that pain manual to help write the
manual for his dissertation on Cognitive Therapy vs ACT  for depression. One reason to think that: the onion skin
carbon copy of that pain protocol was only found in February 2024 (!) while looking for the first ""Big D""
manual, and Rob found it not in the files for the pain study , but in the cardboard box of files for his dissertation
... as if the protocol was relocated for his reference. 
Rob recalls running two subjects for his dissertation project in Greensboro before he left for his internship at the
Center for Cognitive Therapy in Philadelphia in the summer of 1982. For that reason he thinks he was writing
that protocol in the Fall 1981. His dissertation was conducted with the cooperation and support of Aaron Beck
(note, ACT  was never ""at war"" with Tim Beck!) and was defended in 1984 under the title ""Cognitive Therapy of
Depression: A Conceptual and Empirical Analysis of Component and Process Issues"" (ProQuest Dissertations
Publishing, 1984, 8509189). Incidentally in the context of the recent move toward ACT  as a form of ""Process-
Based Therapy"" it is worth noting the title of this first randomized controlled clinical trial on ACT! ACT  was
always  a form of process-based therapy -- it's just now we have a name for that view .
The pain study was put in a file drawer , not because it was bad but because it was good, and Steve thought it
would be more prudent to work out the issues of process measures, components, basic principles of rule-
governance and relational framing, and philosophy of science issues before emphasizing outcomes alone.  
That took far longer than anyone thought at the time and thus the pain study was only published in 1999, 17
years after it was finished: Hayes, S. C., Bissett, R., Korn, Z., Zettle, R. D., Rosenfarb, I., Cooper , L., & Grundt,
A. (1999). The impact of acceptance versus control rationales on pain tolerance. The Psychological Recor d, 49,
33-47.
An unfortunate historical note is that the pain manual was lost -- although Steve remembered seeing it more than
once over the years, it was simply not in Steve's box of materials about the pain study when ACT  began to be
studied again for outcomes in the late 1990's. This meant that the two labs that were first interested -- Dermot
Barnes-Holmes and Bryan Roche -- had to wander in the wilderness trying to replicate it. Both labs eventually
did, but it took years to dial in the preparation, so progress was needlessly delayed and ef fort was wasted. That is2/24/25, 1:08 PM About ACT
https://contextualscience.org/book/export/html/240 117/118
one reason why finding the actual manual (25 years after its publication and 42 years after the study itself!) is of
such historical importance.
Rob Zettle has written a history of this era and later eras of ACT  development. The article describing these early
days and more is attached below .

Objective: Randomized comparisons of acceptance-based treatments with traditional cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders are lacking. To address this gap, we compared acceptance and commit-ment therapy (ACT) to CBT for heterogeneous anxiety disorders. Method: One hundred twenty-eight
individuals (52% female, mean age /H1100538, 33% minority) with 1 or more DSM–IV anxiety disorders began
treatment following randomization to CBT or ACT; both treatments included behavioral exposure. Assess-ments at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up measured anxiety-specific (principaldisorder Clinical Severity Ratings [CSRs], Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, FearQuestionnaire avoidance) and non-anxiety-specific (Quality of Life Index [QOLI], Acceptance and ActionQuestionnaire–16 [AAQ]) outcomes. Treatment adherence, therapist competency ratings, treatment credibil-ity, and co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders were investigated. Results: CBT and ACT improved
similarly across all outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. During follow-up, ACT showed steeper linear CSRimprovements than CBT ( p/H11021.05,d/H110051.26), and at 12-month follow-up, ACT showed lower CSRs than CBT
among completers ( p/H11021.05,d/H110051.10). At 12-month follow-up, ACT reported higher AAQ than CBT ( p/H11005
.08,d/H110050.42; completers: p/H11021.05,d/H110050.56), whereas CBT reported higher QOLI than ACT ( p/H11021.05,d/H11005
0.42). Attrition and comorbidity improvements were similar; ACT used more non-study psychotherapy at6-month follow-up. Therapist adherence and competency were good; treatment credibility was higher in CBT.Conclusions: Overall improvement was similar between ACT and CBT, indicating that ACT is a highly
viable treatment for anxiety disorders.

Several decades ago, the development of behavioral and cogni-
tive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders (Barlow & Cerny,1988; Beck, Emery, & Greenberg, 1985) introduced time-limited,relatively effective treatments. Numerous randomized clinical tri-als and meta-analyses (e.g., Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck,2006; Hofmann & Smits, 2008; Norton & Price, 2007; Tolin,2010) have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for anxietydisorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specificphobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder, relative to waitlist and/or
psychological control conditions. As a result of clinical efficacyand ease of implementation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)has become the dominant empirically validated treatment for anx-iety disorders. However, a significant percentage of individualswith anxiety disorders do not respond to CBT (e.g., Barlow,Gorman, Shear, & Woods, 2000), relapse following successfultreatment (Brown & Barlow, 1995), seek additional treatment(Brown & Barlow, 1995), or remain vulnerable to developing

anxiety and mood disorders throughout the life span (see Craske,
2003). Further, the cognitive model, which posits that anxietydisorders stem from faulty cognitions and are treated by modifyingthe content of these cognitions, has been challenged by insufficientsupporting evidence (see Longmore & Worrell, 2007) and theo-retical arguments (see Brewin, 1996).
In attempt to broaden, improve upon, and provide theoretically
strong alternatives to traditional (cognitive model-based) CBT, clini-cal researchers have shown increasing interest in mindfulness andacceptance-based treatments for psychopathology. Multiple treatmentapproaches have developed out of this exploration, including accep-tance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson,1999), a behavioral therapy that cultivates mindfulness, acceptance,cognitive defusion (flexible distancing from the literal meaning ofcognitions), and other strategies to increase psychological flexibilityand promote behavior change consistent with personal values. WithinACT, psychological flexibility is defined as enhancing the capacity tomake contact with experience in the present moment, and based onwhat is possible in that moment, persisting in or changing behavior inthe pursuit of goals and values (Hayes et al., 1999). Case studies,multiple-baseline treatment studies, and a single randomized clinicaltrial provide nascent evidence that ACT is an effective treatment foranxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (Twohiget al., 2010), social anxiety disorder (Dalrymple & Herbert, 2007),panic disorder (Eifert et al., 2009), generalized anxiety disorder(Wetherell et al., 2011), and posttraumatic stress disorder (Orsillo &Batten, 2005). However, no randomized clinical trials for anxietydisorders have yet compared ACT with the gold-standard therapy foranxiety disorders, CBT.
Several studies have compared ACT and CBT within general clinic
samples. One randomized effectiveness trial ( n/H11005101) in undiag-
nosed anxious and depressed patients (Forman, Herbert, Moitra, Yeo-mans, & Geller, 2007) compared ACT and CBT,
1concluding that the
two treatments were equally effective across symptom outcome mea-
sures but operated via somewhat different mechanisms. A small ( n/H11005
28) randomized treatment study comparing ACT and CBT for undi-agnosed “general clinic patients” (Lappalainen et al., 2007) found thatACT reduced symptoms to a greater degree than CBT and affectedtreatment processes at a different rate. In neither study, however, wereanxiety disorders formally diagnosed, significantly limiting the con-clusions for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Roemer and Orsillo(2007; Roemer, Orsillo, & Salters-Pedneault, 2008) developed anacceptance-based treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)that integrated several ACT principles and found it to be significantlysuperior to a waitlist control group for the treatment of generalizedanxiety disorder. However, this promising treatment was developedfor generalized anxiety disorder alone, and it has not yet been com-pared to another active treatment.
In summary, important work has begun to investigate ACT for
anxiety disorders, but studies to date have not compared ACT tothe most evidence-based psychotherapy for the majority of anxietydisorders, CBT. Directly comparing traditional CBT and ACT foranxiety disorders within a randomized clinical trial bridges a vitalgap in the empirical treatment literature, fulfilling the gold-standard method for investigating the relative efficacy of twotreatments for anxiety disorders (Chambless & Hollon, 1998).Further, it provides an opportunity to compare the efficacy oftreatment packages that contain distinct strategies for dealing withmaladaptive cognitions (change the content of thoughts in CBT vs.change the context by challenging the need to respond rigidly and
literally to cognitions in ACT) and uncomfortable internal expe-riences (to master and reduce anxiety in CBT vs. open toward andaccept anxiety in ACT) and that promote different treatment goals(anxiety reduction in CBT vs. living a valued life in ACT).
The current study compares ACT and CBT in a mixed anxiety
disorders sample for two reasons. First, ACT (Hayes et al., 1999)originally was developed for the treatment of psychopathology ingeneral rather than a specific disorder in particular. The ACTprotocol used in the current study (Eifert & Forsyth, 2005) wasdesigned for application across all of the anxiety disorders, withthe content of values-guided behavioral exercises tailored to spe-cific anxiety disorders. Second, CBT shares common treatmentelements across the anxiety disorders with variation in contentspecific to each disorder. We thus designed a CBT manual thataddressed all anxiety disorders via branching mechanisms specificto each disorder. Our CBT protocol included the same basictreatment elements across all of the disorders (e.g., psychoeduca-tion, cognitive restructuring, exposure—see Method section) buttailored the content of these elements to each specific disorder, anapproach we have successfully tested in previous studies (e.g.,Craske et al., 2011).
We assessed patients at four longitudinal measurement points,
including pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up, and12-month follow-up, providing a thorough assessment oftreatment-related change over time. Due to limited extant data, wedid not make specific predictions regarding whether one treatmentwould lead to greater reductions in anxiety disorder-related symp-toms than the other treatment. Rather, investigating this questionrepresented a central study aim. However, given the emphasis inACT on psychological flexibility and valued living, we hypothe-sized that these measures would improve to a greater degreefollowing ACT than CBT.
Method
Participants
One hundred and forty-three participants meeting Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM–IV ;
American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for a diagnosis ofone or more anxiety disorders, including panic disorder with orwithout agoraphobia (PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), spe-cific phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or gen-eralized anxiety disorder (GAD),
2were randomized to ACT ( n/H11005
65) or CBT ( n/H1100578). All participants who began treatment ( n/H11005
128) were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample ( n/H1100557
ACT, n/H1100571 CBT). See Table 1 for ITT sample characteristics
1The study called their approach “cognitive therapy,” which they de -
fined as the Beck-based treatment subtype of CBT (see Forman et al.,2007).
2Only four participants met principal diagnosis of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), perhaps because our recruitment materials stated “anxiety
disorders” but not “trauma,” therefore attracting fewer PTSD participants.Of these, one did not begin treatment, one dropped treatment, and twocompleted treatment. Due to the very small sample size for this disorder(three total PTSD participants who began treatment and only one in ACT),these participants were excluded from analyses.751 CBT VERSUS ACT FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS

and Figure 1 for patient flow. Fifteen of the original 143 partici-
pants, blinded to treatment randomization (unaware if they hadbeen randomized to ACT or CBT), dropped prior to treatmentinitiation. Because pre-treatment attrition gave us no informationabout treatment preference or response, we did not analyze thoseparticipants further. Participants who dropped prior to treatmentdid not differ significantly from participants who began treatmenton any sociodemographic variable from Table 1 ( ps/H11350.20), nor
did not differ by blind assignment to ACT versus CBT ( n/H110058
each, p/H11005.66). Participants who dropped treatment showed some-
what higher Clinical Severity Ratings (CSRs; M/H110056.07, SD/H11005
0.96) relative to participants who began treatment ( M/H110055.63,
SD/H110050.92), but group differences were small and did not reach
statistical significance ( p/H11005.08,/H9257
p2/H11005.02). Eleven of the 15
participants (73%) dropped prior to completing the pre-treatment
questionnaire assessment; therefore, we could not determine ifthey differed from participants who initiated treatment on ques-tionnaire measures.
Participants were recruited from the Los Angeles area in re-
sponse to local flyers, Craigslist and local newspaper advertise-ments, and referrals. The study took place at the Anxiety DisordersResearch Center at the University of California Los Angeles(UCLA), Department of Psychology.
Participants were either medication free or stabilized on psy-
chotropic medications for a minimum standard length of time (1month for benzodiazepines and beta blockers, 3 months for selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] and heterocyclics).Also, participants were psychotherapy free or stabilized on alter-
native psychotherapies other than cognitive or behavioral therapiesthat were not focused on their anxiety disorder, for at least 6months prior to study entry. Participants were encouraged not tochange their non-study medication or alternative psychotherapyduring the course of the study. Exclusion criteria included activesuicidal ideation; severe depression (CSR /H110226 on ADIS–IV; see
below); or a history of bipolar disorder, psychosis, mental retar-dation, or organic brain damage. Participants with substance abuseor dependence within the last 6 months or with respiratory, car-diovascular, pulmonary, neurological, muscular-skeletal diseases,or pregnancy were excluded.
Participants received 12 weeks of reduced-cost, sliding scale
($0–100/session) individual treatment and received $15–$25 incash or a gift certificate upon completion of the post-treatment andeach follow-up assessment. Participants were reimbursed forUCLA parking fees for the assessments ($8–$10). The study wasfully approved by the UCLA human subjects protection commit-tee; full informed consent was obtained from all participants,including for video- and audiorecordings.
Design
Participants were assessed at pre-treatment (Pre), post-treatment
(Post), and at 6 months (6mFU) and 12 months (12mFU) after Pre.Assessments included a diagnostic interview, self-report question-naires, and a 2- to 3-hr laboratory assessment (except at 6mFU)reported elsewhere. Assessors were blind to treatment condition.Table 1

Randomization sequences were produced by http://www.randomizer
.org; therapists were requested not to inform participants of their
assigned treatment condition. For the first two quarters of the study,
participants were randomized 1:1 CBT to ACT. In the third quarter,participants were randomized 2:1 CBT to ACT due to the greateravailability of CBT-trained therapists. In the final quarter, to equalizecondition assignments, participants were randomized 1:2 CBT toACT. Because fewer participants were recruited in the fourth com-pared to the third quarter, the total number of participants who begantreatment in each condition was unequal ( n/H1100557 to ACT; n/H1100571 to
CBT). To maximize statistical power for the main group comparisonhypotheses, we did not stratify patients on any variables.
Treatments
Following the Pre ADIS–IV and laboratory assessments, partic-
ipants were randomized to treatment condition. Participants re-ceived 12 weekly, 1-hr individual CBT or ACT therapy sessionsbased on detailed treatment manuals delivered by doctoral student
therapists.
3If clients presented with multiple anxiety disorders,
treatment focused on the principal disorder. Following the 12
sessions, therapists conducted follow-up phone calls once permonth for 6 months, allowing 20–35 min per call to check in andtroubleshoot in a manner consistent with the assigned therapycondition, to enhance long-term outcomes (see Craske et al.,2006).

therapists. The majority of therapists were relatively naı ¨ve to CBT

second year of treating patients).4Therapists were assigned to
ACT, CBT, or both (i.e., treated in both CBT and ACT, though
never at the same time), depending on the need for therapists in aparticular condition and the availability of training in that condi-tion (e.g., a multi-day training workshop with an ACT or CBTexpert; see below). There were a total of 39 therapists; 18 thera-pists worked exclusively in CBT, 9 worked exclusively in ACT,and 11 treated both ACT and CBT participants (but never at thesame time). Generally, therapists treated one to two patients at atime and three to six therapists worked within each treatmentcondition at a time. The mean number of patients treated byCBT-only therapists was 1.94 ( SD/H110051.16; range 1–4) for a total
of 35 participants, by ACT-only therapists was 1.89 ( SD/H110051.05;
range 1–4) for a total of 17 participants, and by therapists whotreated in both conditions was 6.82 ( SD/H110051.60; range 4–9) for a
total of 75 participants. The mean patient number for therapiststreating in both conditions was significantly higher than the meanfor ACT- or CBT-only therapists ( ps/H11021.001,/H9257
p2/H11005.77 for each
comparison; there were no differences between ACT- and CBT-
only therapists). This is because therapists were allowed to gaintraining in the second treatment modality (e.g., in CBT if theystarted out in ACT) only if they had seen at least several patientsin their original modality (e.g., in ACT). Consequently, therapistswho treated in both conditions treated more patients overall. Wetested the possibility, therefore, that therapists treating in differentconditions would evidence systematic differences in competencythat impacted study findings (see Results section).
Weekly, hour-long group supervision for study therapists was
led separately by the principal authors of the treatment manualsand by advanced therapists from UCLA and from Dr. Hayes’laboratory at the University of Nevada Reno, where ACT wasoriginally developed. All sessions were videotaped for supervisionpurposes with a hidden video camera; sessions were also audio-taped for therapy adherence purposes with a discrete digital re-corder. Videos were generally played in supervision sessions orwatched beforehand by supervisors. ACT supervision occurred byphone and Skype with offsite supervisors, supplemented by occa-sional face-to-face sessions, whereas CBT supervision was face-to-face. All therapists completed extensive training including anintensive 3-day workshop with the principal treatment manualauthor (author Craske for CBT, and author Eifert or Dr. Hayes forACT) prior to treating participants. ACT and CBT manuals werematched on the number of sessions devoted to exposure butdiffered in coping skills and the framing of exposure intent.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT for anxiety dis-
orders followed a protocol authored by Craske (2005), whichinvolved a single manual with branching mechanisms that listedcognitive restructuring and behavioral exposure content for eachanxiety disorder. Session 1 focused on assessment, self-monitoring, and psychoeducation. Sessions 2–4 emphasized cog-nitive restructuring with hypothesis testing, self-monitoring, andbreathing retraining. Exposure (e.g., interoceptive, in-vivo, andimaginal) was tailored to the principal diagnosis and focused onempiricism and anxiety reduction over time; it was introduced inSession 5 and emphasized strongly in Sessions 6–11. Session 12focused on relapse prevention.
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT for anx-
iety disorders followed a manual authored by Eifert and Forsyth(2005). Session 1 focused on psychoeducation, experiential exercises,and discussion that introduced acceptance, creative hopelessness, and
valued action. Creative hopelessness involved a process of exploringwhether efforts to manage and control anxiety had “worked” andexperiencing how such efforts had led to the reduction or eliminationof valued life activities. Participants were encouraged to behave inways that enacted their personal values (“valued action”), rather thanspend time managing anxiety. Acceptance was explored as an alter-native to controlling anxiety. Sessions 2–3 further explored creativehopelessness and acceptance. Sessions 4 and 5 emphasized mindful-ness, acceptance, and cognitive defusion, or the process of experienc-ing anxiety-related language (e.g., thoughts, self-talk, etc.) as part ofthe broader, ongoing stream of present experience rather than gettingstuck in responding to its literal meaning. Sessions 6–11 continued tohone acceptance, mindfulness, and defusion and added values explo-ration and clarification with the goal of increasing willingness topursue valued life activities. Behavioral exposures, including intero-ceptive, in-vivo, and imaginal, were employed as needed to provideopportunities to practice making room for, mindfully observing, andaccepting anxiety (all types of exposure) and to practice engaging invalued activities while experiencing anxiety (in-vivo exposures). Ses-sion 12 reviewed what worked and how to continue moving forward.See the supplemental materials for additional details.
Outcome Measures
Because CBT emphasized symptom reduction, whereas ACT
emphasized broader aims of psychological flexibility and valuedliving, we investigated two sets of primary outcomes across bothtreatments: anxiety-specific (i.e., symptom reduction related) andnon-anxiety-specific, or broader, outcomes. For the anxiety-specific measures, we included the severity of each principalanxiety disorder. In addition, the mixed anxiety disorder nature ofour sample required utilization of anxiety-specific outcome mea-sures that were relevant across the anxiety disorders. We selectedmeasures of worry, fear, and behavioral avoidance, features thatcharacterize all anxiety disorders (Craske et al., 2009), and empir-ically tested them to ensure that they changed following treatmentacross the entire sample (not merely within a single disorder). Forthe non-anxiety-specific, broader measures we assessed quality oflife and psychological flexibility.
Anxiety-Specific Primary Outcomes
Diagnostic interview assessment. Clinical diagnoses were
ascertained using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule–IV(ADIS–IV; Brown, DiNardo, & Barlow, 1994). Doctoral studentsin clinical psychology or research assistants served as interviewersafter completing 15–20 hr of training and demonstrating adequatediagnostic reliability on three consecutive interviews. “Clinicalseverity ratings” (CSRs) were made for each disorder by groupconsensus o na0t o8 scale (0 /H11005none ,8/H11005extremely severe ).
Ratings of 4 or higher indicated clinical significance based onsymptom severity, distress, and disablement and served as thecutoff for study eligibility (see Craske et al., 2007). ADIS–IVinterviews were audiorecorded, and 15% ( n/H1100522) were randomly
4Prior to study training, therapists had received only one or two lectures
on CBT and one lecture incorporating third-wave behavioral therapies at
the point of initial study involvement.754 ARCH ET AL.

selected for blind rating by a second interviewer.5Inter-rater
reliability on the principal diagnosis was 100%. Inter-rater agree-
ment on dimensional CSR ratings was .65 with a single-measure,one-way mixed intraclass correlation
6coefficient (ICC) across the
anxiety disorders. Inter-rater agreement for each specific disorder
(met DSM–IV criteria vs. subclinical vs. none) was as follows:
SAD (10 subclinical or clinical cases) and OCD (3 cases) ICC /H11005
1.00 (100% agreement); PD/A (11 cases) ICC /H11005.91; GAD (8
cases) ICC /H11005.85; and SP (7 cases) ICC /H11005.75.
The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson & Reiss, 1993;
Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986)7assesses fear of
anxiety-related sensations (e.g., shortness of breath) based on the
belief that such sensations are harmful. Although particularlyelevated in panic disorder (Taylor, Koch, & McNally, 1992), theASI shows elevation across most anxiety disorders (Rapee, Brown,Antony, & Barlow, 1992) relative to non-anxious controls (Peter-son & Reiss, 1993). Current sample alphas were .85 (Pre) and .93(Post). The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer,Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990) assesses clinically relevantworry. Although particularly elevated in GAD, the PSWQ showselevations across all anxiety disorders relative to non-anxiouscontrols (Brown, Antony, & Barlow, 1992). Current sample alphaswere .90 (Pre) and .93 (Post). The Fear Questionnaire’s (FQ;Marks & Mathews, 1979) Main Target Phobia Scale, a single-itemavoidance rating for each participant’s “main phobia,” was used asthe behavioral avoidance outcome.
Broader (Non-Anxiety-Specific) Primary Outcomes
The Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI; Frisch, 1994a, 1994b)
assesses values and life satisfaction across 16 broad life domainsand has good test–retest reliability and internal validity (Frisch etal., 2005). Current alphas were .86 (Pre) and .84 (Post). TheAcceptance and Action Questionnaire–16 (AAQ; Bond & Bunce,2000; Hayes et al., 2004) assesses psychological flexibility (Bondet al., 2011). The AAQ is a 16-item version of the seven- andnine-item AAQ that is hypothesized to be more sensitive to clinicalchange (Hayes et al., 2004). Both one- and two-factor solutionshave been fit to the 16-item AAQ (Bond & Bunce, 2000, 2003).Herein, a one-factor scale was used, with higher scores indicatinggreater psychological flexibility. Current alphas were .78 (Pre) and.86 (Post). See supplemental materials for additional psychomet-rics on primary outcomes.
Secondary Outcomes
Use of additional treatment. As a behavioral indication of
the degree to which each treatment met clients’ needs, we assessedparticipants’ reported use of additional (non-study-related) psy-chotherapy and psychotropic medication at Post-12mFU withquestions on the ADIS–IV. At each assessment point, we com-pared groups on the portion of participants who initiated new,dropped (e.g., among participants using therapy or medication atthe previous assessment point), or were using any form (e.g., eithernew or continued from the previous assessment) of non-studypsychotherapy or psychotropic medication.
Generalization of treatment effects. Based on the ADIS–IV
interview, co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders (with CSRs of4/H11001) at Post-12mFU were analyzed as an index of the generaliza-tion of treatment effects. We examined the number of co-occurring
anxiety disorders, the presence of co-occurring mood disorders,and the total number of co-occurring anxiety and mood disordersas indices of the generalization of treatment effects.
Treatment Credibility
Prior to the second therapy session, after the treatment rationale
had been fully described, participants completed a six-item treat-ment credibility questionnaire adapted from Borkovec and Nau(1972; see supplemental materials). Total sample alpha was .94,ACT alpha was .92, and CBT alpha was .95.
Treatment Adherence and Therapist Competence
Treatment sessions were audiotaped, and 143 sessions from 91
participants (50 in CBT, 41 in ACT) were randomly selected fortreatment adherence and therapist competency ratings using theDrexel University ACT/CT Therapist Adherence and CompetenceRating Scale (DUACRS; McGrath, Forman, & Herbert, 2012).The treatment adherence items ( n/H1100549) included five scales:
General Therapy Adherence (12 items), General Behavioral TherapyAdherence (11 items), Cognitive Therapy Adherence (10 items), ACTAdherence (16 items), and Therapist Competence (5 items; see sup-plemental materials). The first author of the DUACRS (McGrath),who had no involvement with the current study and extensivetraining in both ACT and CBT, completed adherence ratings. Tocheck treatment integrity, the blind rater (McGrath) noted which of49 therapist adherence items (e.g., specific therapist behaviors ortherapy content) occurred in each 5-min segment of therapy.Treatment-specific subscale scores (indicating adherence to ACTor CBT) were calculated by dividing the number of segmentsduring which subscale-specific therapist behavior was present (i.e.,at least one of the items composing a subscale was coded for that5-min segment) by the total number of segments in the session,yielding an estimate of the percentage of time spent by the ther-apist on treatment-specific behavior. The General Therapy Adher-ence and General Behavioral Therapy Adherence scales werecomputed in similar manner. At the end of each recording, thera-pist competence was rated and the mean of the scale items repre-sented the therapist competency rating for that session.
Statistical Analyses
Raw data were inspected graphically; outliers (3 SD) were
replaced with the next higher value, following the Winsor method(Guttman, 1973), prior to data analysis. In full hierarchical linearmodeling (HLM) models (see below), Level 1 and 2 residuals wereexamined for model outliers and fit, and outliers (3 SD) were
5Given the mixed anxiety disorder sample and subsequently low sample
size per disorder, ICCs for individual disorders should be interpreted
cautiously. Note, however, that agreement was based on all 22 ratedaudiotapes, not just the audiotapes of participants with clinically significantsymptoms.
6This test was selected because the second interviewers included several

treated in the Winsor method and on two occasions, eliminated due
to particularly strong and uncorrectable influence. Less than 5% ofthe data were modified or eliminated during outlier correction.
Longitudinal data were analyzed with HLM and hierarchical
multiple linear modeling (HMLM) in HLM 6.0 (Raudenbush,Bryk, & Congdon, 2004). HLM/HMLM random effects modelsexamined within- and between-group change across time (Pre,Post, 6mFU, 12mFU) and by condition (ACT and CBT). HLM/HMLM incorporates participants with missing data by estimatingthe best fitting model from the data available for each participant(Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006). Therefore, for the intent-to-treat(ITT) analyses, all data points for participants who entered treat-ment were entered into the model. For completer results, which arereported when different from ITT results, analyses included par-ticipants who completed treatment and at least one subsequentassessment (Post, 6mFU, 12mFU). In fitting models to the longi-tudinal data, different variance–covariance structures were as-sessed starting with the simplest, the HLM compound symmetrymodel. HLM model fit was compared with multiple HMLM Level1 variance–covariance options (homogenous, heterogeneous, first-order autoregressive, unstructured) using restricted log likelihoodvalues (–2LL) in chi-square comparisons (see Raudenbush, Bryk,Cheong, & Congdon, 2004). The model with the best fit wasselected; if models were not significantly different, the model withthe fewest parameters was selected.
In the HLM/HMLM models, assessment time points (Pre, Post,
6mFU, 12mFU) were entered on Level 1 and nested within indi-viduals on Level 2. Demographic and clinical covariates and group(dummy coded ACT vs. CBT and centered at /H11002.5, .5) were entered
on Level 2. Between-group differences focused on group differ-ences in change slopes over time and at Post and 12mFU timepoints. In all HLM/HMLM analyses, all data points were includedin the models. For the Post and 12mFU analyses, the intercept wasshifted to Post or 12mFU to facilitate group comparisons at thosetime points. Due to curvilinear change patterns over time, qua-dratic and cubic time terms were tested on Level 1 and kept in finalmodels if they were significant and significantly reduced modeldeviance (–2LL) according to chi-square-based model compari-sons. Cubic terms were fixed in order to not overestimate themodel’s random effects. For analyses of non-CSR outcomes, pre-CSR was covaried on the intercept to account for pre-treatmentdiagnostic severity. Effect sizes for within-group change at eachassessment point were examined in models that included linear andquadratic slopes only for the sake of clarity and brevity and toavoid overinflating within-group linear effect sizes, which canoccur when both quadratic and cubic terms are in the model. Wecomputed deffect sizes that accounted for the number of repeated
measurement periods as needed (Feingold, 2009)
8and used Co -
hen’s (1988) guidelines for interpretation. For ease of effect sizecomparisons between the ITT and completer samples, we used theITT standard deviations in all effect size computations.
Differences in rate of improvement should translate into differ-
ent outcomes at post-treatment or follow-up. Therefore, the Postand 12mFU time points represented our main time points ofinterest for examining cross sectional group differences.
For comorbidity analyses, we compared groups at Pre using
chi-square and over time using generalized hierarchical linear
modeling (GHLM) random effects repeated-measure models (seeRaudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2004), which utilize
participants with incomplete data.
Three separate indices examined treatment response in terms of the
percentage of responders at each assessment point (Post, 6mFU,12mFU); chi-square analyses examined between-group differences.Diagnostic status improvement was defined in accordance with recentclinical trials (Newman et al., 2011; Roemer et al., 2008) as aprincipal diagnosis CSR of 3 or below. Reliable change was com-puted using the Jacobson and Truax (1991) method, using the moreconservative denominator recommended by Maassen (2004). To re-main consistent with previous randomized clinical trials, we focusedthe response indices on anxiety-specific outcomes. Due to the range ofprincipal disorders and conservative method of defining change, weexamined group differences in reliable change on at least two of fouranxiety-specific primary outcomes (reliable change status), as well asreliable change plus falling within 1 SDof the non-clinical normative
range (or 3 or less on CSR) on at least two of four anxiety-specificprimary outcomes (high end-state functioning status) and reliablechange on the principal disorder CSR plus CSR of 3 or below(diagnostic change status). See supplemental materials for employednorms and computations details and Table 6 for reliable changecritical values.
To assess if data were missing at random, we conducted chi-square
comparisons on primary outcomes comparing participants whodropped out versus finished treatment and treatment finishers withcomplete versus incomplete data at 6mFU and 12mFU. For dropoutsversus finishers, no significant differences emerged at Pre on anyprimary outcome variable. For treatment finishers with completeversus incomplete data, no significant differences emerged at Pre orPost, with the minor exception that participants with incomplete FUdata had higher ASI scores at Pre ( p/H11005.04,/H9257
p2/H11005.05) but not at Post.
The findings suggest that the data were missing at random.
Power analyses, conducted in Optimal Design (see Raudenbush
& Liu, 2000), indicated that to reach 80% power, a cross-sectionalbetween-group difference (e.g., at 12mFU) with an effect size of0.70 required 67 total participants, whereas a between-group effectsize of 0.50 required 126 total participants. Therefore, our totalsample size ( n/H11005128) was sufficient to detect between-group
differences of moderate size at each assessment point.
Results
Pre-Treatment Group Differences
At pre-treatment, ACT and CBT evidenced no significant dif-
ferences on anxiety-specific or broader outcome measures, al-though ASI differences approached significance, t(111)/H110051.91,
p/H11005.058 (all other outcomes, ps/H11022.2). Further, ACT (8.82%,
3/34) and CBT (9.68%, 3/31)
9showed no differences in use of
non-study psychotherapy at Pre, /H92732/H110050.01, p/H11005.91, nor in use of
8We did not report 95% confidence intervals for our Feingold (2009)
effect sizes because there is not yet a method for doing so (see Feingold,
2009; Odgaard & Fowler, 2010).
9To comply with institutional review board requirements, the original
ADIS–IVs had already been shred for the remaining half of the sample by
the point at which we extracted these data. There is no reason to believe,however, that the remaining half differed from the first half in use ofnon-study psychotherapy.756 ARCH ET AL.

psychotropic medication (see Table 1). ACT and CBT showed no
significant differences on socio-demographic or clinical character-istics in Table 1, with one exception. Despite randomization pro-cedures, there was a trend for higher rates of a principal diagnosisof PD/A in CBT (49.3%) than in ACT (32.1%), /H9273
2/H110053.79, p/H11005
.052. In HLM analyses, principal PD/A diagnosis predicted supe-
rior CSR outcomes compared to non-PD/A principal diagnoses, atPost ( B/H11005–1.14, SE/H110050.45), t(126)/H11005–2.53, p/H11005.01,d/H110051.24,
and at 6mFU ( B/H11005–1.01, SE/H110050.51), t(126)/H11005–2.11, p/H11005.04,
d/H110051.10, but not at 12mFU ( B/H11005–0.62, p/H11005.26). Despite the
significant impact of PD/A on CSR outcomes, we did not covaryPD/A in further HLM/HMLM analyses to avoid further stratifica-tion of participants into additional subgroups that lacked a priorisignificance and to avoid reduced statistical power to examine ourprincipal comparison of CBT versus ACT. Principal PD/A did notpredict other primary outcomes for which we found significantCBT versus ACT differences.
Treatment Credibility
Treatment credibility scores (immediately prior to Session 2)
differed significantly by group, F(1, 76) /H110059.08, p/H11005.004,/H9257p2/H11005
.11, with CBT evidencing higher scores ( M/H110056.08, SD/H110051.44,
n/H1100551) than ACT ( M/H110054.92, SD/H110051.91, n/H1100527). Missing
treatment credibility data from the first 24 ACT participants10
resulted in a lower sample size in this group. When the first 24CBT participants were excluded from analyses, group differencesheld: F(1, 62) /H110056.34, p/H11005.01,/H9257
p2/H11005.09, with CBT again showing
significantly higher scores ( M/H110056.00, SD/H110051.53, n/H1100537) than
ACT ( M/H110054.92, SD/H110051.91, n/H1100527).
Therapist Competence and Treatment Integrity
Therapist Competence scale scores (e.g., “knowledge of treat-
ment,” “skill in delivering treatment,” and “relationship with client”;1/H11005poor,3/H11005good ,5/H11005excellent ) indicated “good” therapist skills
in CBT ( M/H110053.08, SD/H110050.64) and ACT ( M/H110053.25, SD/H110050.77).
ACT therapists and CBT therapists did not significantly differ oncompetency ratings, F(1, 77) /H110051.17, p/H11005.28,/H9257
p2/H11005.02.
Cognitive therapy adherence scores were higher for CBT (M /H11005
62.23, SD/H1100518.07) than ACT ( M/H110055.03, SD/H110059.83), F(1, 87) /H11005
316.88, p/H11021.001,/H9257p2/H11005.76. Conversely, ACT adherence scores
were higher for ACT ( M/H1100582.26, SD/H1100518.04) than CBT ( M/H11005
3.94, SD/H110056.40), F(1, 87) /H11005813.58, p/H11021.001,/H9257p2/H11005.90. On the
Behavioral Adherence scale, CBT ( M/H1100547.41, SD/H1100523.59)
scored significantly higher than ACT ( M/H1100525.35, SD/H1100518.83),
F(1, 87) /H1100522.77, p/H11021.001,/H9257p2/H11005.21; however, this scale included
a range of behavioral items such as therapist modeling that are
more commonly used in CBT. We explored group differences onbehavioral exposure-related items from the Behavioral Adherencescale; differences between CBT ( M/H1100514.25, SD/H1100518.34) and
ACT ( M/H110058.01, SD/H1100511.77) on behavioral exposure items ( p/H11005
.07,/H9257
p2/H11005.04) did not reach full significance. The General Therapy
Adherence scale did not differ significantly between CBT ( M/H11005
96.89, SD/H110059.86) and ACT ( M/H1100599.10, SD/H110054.27), F(1, 87) /H11005
1.72, p/H11005.19,/H9257p2/H11005.02. The combined results show that therapists
exhibited strong adherence to their assigned treatment.
To test the possibility that therapists treating in different condi-
tions varied in competence, we compared CBT-only, ACT-only,and both-type (e.g., treated participants in both CBT and ACT)
therapists on competence. CBT-only ( M/H110052.96, SD/H110050.64) and
ACT-only therapists ( M/H110053.02, SD/H110050.62) showed no differ-
ences in competence ( p/H11005.81), nor did ACT-only and both-type
therapists ( p/H11005.13). Both-type therapists, however, showed sig-
nificantly higher competence ( M/H110053.36, SD/H110050.72) than CBT-
only therapists ( M/H110052.96, SD/H110050.64), F(1, 73) /H110055.18, p/H11005.03,
/H9257p2/H11005.07. To determine if therapists who treated in a single
condition impacted study findings, we reran the CSR analyses
twice, once without CBT-only therapists and once without CBT-and ACT-only therapists. Although reduced power from a lowersample size (which meant the analyses fell below the 80% statis-tical power level) meant that group differences were not statisti-cally significant, the pattern of findings for group differencesmatched those reported for the full sample below, suggesting thattherapist assignment did not impact study findings. See supple-mental materials for an example of these results.
Treatment Attrition
Eighty-five of 128 participants (66%) completed the full 12 ses-
sions of therapy, including 68% (48/71) in CBT and 65% (37/57) inACT. The additional 43 participants (34%) received a partial dose oftherapy: 13 participants attended one session (5 ACT, 8 CBT) and 30participants (15 in each ACT and CBT) attended two to 11 therapysessions. The portion of participants who did not complete the full 12sessions did not differ by group, /H9273
2(1)/H110050.40, ns. Finally, the total
number of treatment sessions attended by the ITT sample did not
differ by group: CBT M/H110059.62 ( SD/H110054.08), ACT M/H110059.37 ( SD/H11005
4.05), F(1, 126) /H110050.12, p/H11005.73,/H9257p2/H11005.00.
Primary Outcomes
Table 2 provides the means and standard deviations for primary
outcomes at each assessment point. We conducted separate ITTand treatment completer analyses. Completer analyses are reportedwhen they differ in significance or effect size from the ITTanalyses. Effect sizes for within-group and between-group changeare listed by group in Table 3. Table 4 provides the means,standard deviations, effect sizes, and diagnostic response rates forCSR outcomes at Post for each anxiety disorder. Individual disor-der outcomes were not analyzed or discussed further, however,because we did not design or power this study to examine groupdifferences in outcomes for individual anxiety disorders.
Primary Outcome Change Slopes: ITT Sample
Anxiety-specific outcomes. With the intercept (0) represent-
ing Pre, the HLM ITT model for CSR outcomes showed signifi-cant effects of linear, quadratic, and cubic change over time (allps/H11021.001), but no significant Group /H11003Time interactions. How-
ever, after treatment, the groups showed significant differences inCSR linear slope (within the full model accounting for group onhigher order change terms and all time points with interceptrepresenting Post) such that ACT continued to improve from Post
10This occurred due to administrative error in which it was not under -
stood that the treatment credibility measure should be administered to boththe CBT and ACT participants.757 CBT VERSUS ACT FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS

to 12mFU, whereas CBT maintained but did not continue to
improve as much, B/H110050.58, SE/H110050.28, t(126)/H110052.03, p/H11005.04,
d/H110051.26 (effect size of group slope difference from Post to
12mFU; see Figure 2A). The CSR slopes after treatment were bestfit within a HMLM unrestricted covariance model.
The HLM ITT model for ASI, PSWQ, and FQ outcomes
showed significant effects of linear, quadratic, and cubic changeover time (all ps/H11021.01), but no significant Group /H11003Time inter-
actions from pre- to post-treatment or after treatment.
Broader outcomes. The HLM ITT models for AAQ and QOLI
outcomes showed significant effects of linear, quadratic, and cubicchange over time (all ps/H11349.001), but no significant Group /H11003Time
interactions from pre- to post-treatment or after treatment.
Primary Outcome Change Slopes: Completer Sample
Anxiety-specific outcomes. Completers evidenced a similar
but smaller Group /H11003Linear Slope interaction for CSR after treatment,
B/H110050.43, SE/H110050.21, t(77)/H110052.05, p/H11005.04,d/H110050.93, favoring ACT.
A HMLM homogenous covariance structure best fit the data.
Primary Outcomes at Post: ITT Sample
Anxiety-specific and broader outcomes. At Post, ACT and
CBT did not differ significantly on any anxiety-specific or broaderoutcome measures.
Primary Outcomes at 12mFU: ITT Sample
Anxiety-specific outcomes. At 12mFU, ACT and CBT did
not differ on any anxiety-specific outcomes.
Broader outcomes. At 12mFU, CBT demonstrated higher
QOLI ratings than ACT, B/H110050.83, SE/H110050.41, t(113) 2.05, p/H11005
.04,d/H110050.42 (see Figure 2B). In addition, group differences in
AAQ approached significance, B/H110055.10, SE/H110052.86, t(117)/H11005
1.78, p/H11005.08,d/H110050.42, with ACT showing greater psychologicalflexibility than CBT (see Figure 2C). An HLM covariance struc-
ture best fit the data for these 12mFU outcomes.
Primary Outcomes at 12mFU: Completer Sample
Anxiety-specific outcomes. At 12mFU, ACT was assigned
significantly lower CSR ratings for the principal anxiety disorder thanCBT, B/H110051.01, SE/H110050.49, t(83)/H110052.04, p/H11005.04,d/H110051.10.
11A
homogenous Level 1 variance HMLM model best fit the CSR data. At
this assessment point (12mFU), PD/A status was unrelated to CSRoutcomes (see Results section), bolstering the significance of thisfinding. The groups did not differ significantly on the ASI, PSWQ, orFQ.
Broader outcomes. At 12mFU, CBT showed higher QOLI
values than ACT, B/H110050.68, SE/H110050.32, t(65)/H110052.12, p/H11005.03,d/H11005
0.34. ACT demonstrated higher AAQ scores than CBT, B/H110056.76,
SE/H110052.65, t(66)/H110052.65, p/H11005.01,d/H110050.56.
Secondary Outcomes
Use of additional psychotherapy and medication. There
were no group differences at Post, 6mFU, or 12mFU in use of new orany (e.g., new or continued) psychotropic medication (all ps/H11022.44;
see supplemental materials). For dropped medication, there was no
11Due to the fact that study selection criteria required a CSR of 4 or
above, the pre-treatment CSR range was restricted. Thus, the pre-treatment
standard deviation, which serves as the denominator in the Feingold (2009)effect size formula, was less than half the standard deviation of the 12mFUCSRs in magnitude (whereas pre-treatment standard deviations on otheroutcome measures were greater than or equal to their standard deviationsat 12mFU). If we use the standard deviation at 12mFU to compute theeffect size for 12mFU group differences on CSR, d/H110050.44. Similarly, if we
use the post-treatment CSR standard deviation to compute the groupdifference in ITT change slopes from Post-12mFU, d/H11005.54.Table 2

group difference at 6mFU ( p/H11022.69), with sample sizes at 12mFU too
small to compare. At Post, however, CBT resulted in borderlinegreater dropped medication than ACT, B/H110052.13, SE/H110051.10, p/H11005.05
(p/H11005.053), Exp( B)/H110058.42 (95% CI [0.97, 73.06]), with 37.04%
(10/27) of CBT versus 7.14% (1/14) of ACT participants droppingmedication from Pre to Post. Because there were no group differencesin overall medication use at Post ( p/H11005.86), however, we did not
further analyze this borderline significant finding.
The groups did not differ in new, dropped, or any outside psycho-
therapy use at either Post or 12mFU ( ps/H11022.26). At 6mFU, groups did
not differ on new ( p/H11005.13) psychotherapy; however, ACT reported
greater use of any psychotherapy (e.g., new or continued) than CBT,B/H110051.29, SE/H110050.63, Wald (1)/H110054.28, p/H11005.04, Exp( B)/H110053.65 (95%
CI [1.07, 12.42]): 39% (11/28) of ACT participants versus 19% (5/27)of CBT participants. To explore the clinical impact of this finding, wereran the CSR analyses dropping the participants who reported anypsychotherapy use at 6mFU and found that the results followed thesame pattern as the ITT analysis reported above. Further, we assessedwhether psychotherapy use at 6mFU predicted principal diagnosisCSRs at 6mFU or 12mFU and found that it did not ( ps/H11022.4 for both
ACT and CBT). Given these two sets of null findings, additionalpsychotherapy at 6mFU was not covaried in subsequent analyses.
Exploratory analyses showed, however, that ACT patients who re-mained severe (CSR 4 /H11001) following treatment were somewhat more
likely to seek additional treatment than CBT patients who remainedsevere ( p/H11005.07; see supplemental materials).
Generalization of treatment effects. The groups did not
differ significantly in the number of co-occurring anxiety, mood,or anxiety and mood disorders combined at Pre ( ps/H11022.18). Nor did
the groups differ significantly in rates of reduction of co-occurringdisorders over time, with both groups showing decreases in co-occurring disorders following treatment (see Table 5).
Treatment Response Rates
The groups did not significantly differ in treatment response
rates (see Table 6).
Discussion
Within a randomized clinical trial, we aimed to test the efficacy
of ACT relative to a gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders,Table 3

CBT. Because ACT represents a transdiagnostic treatment ap-
proach (Hayes et al., 1999), we focused on a mixed anxietydisorder sample. We explored the degree to which each treatmentreduced anxiety symptoms and tested the hypothesis that ACTwould improve on measures of quality of life and psychologicalflexibility to a greater extent than CBT.
Overall, the findings demonstrated that ACT and CBT did not
differ significantly at post-treatment on either anxiety-specific orbroader outcomes. Group differences emerged during the follow-upinterval, however, with ACT showing superiority over CBT on prin-cipal disorder severity and psychological flexibility outcomes. How-ever, group differences are complicated by the fact that significantlymore ACT participants utilized outside psychotherapy during theinitial follow-up interval than CBT participants. Our hypothesis thatACT would improve more than CBT on broader outcomes met withlimited support; on one broad outcome, ACT improved more thanCBT but on the other, CBT improved more than ACT.Primary Outcomes
On all primary outcomes, ACT and CBT showed substantial
improvement from pre- to post-treatment. On anxiety-specificoutcomes, within-group linear effect sizes in ACT and CBT frompre- to post-treatment ranged from very large for principal disorderseverity (CSR) to moderate or large for other anxiety outcomes.Thus, both treatments were highly efficacious. Anxiety-relatedoutcomes continued to improve through the 6-month follow-upassessment within both ACT and CBT. From 6 to 12 months,improvement slowed but treatment gains endured. On broaderoutcomes, both groups showed large linear improvements in psy-chological flexibility and more moderate linear improvements inquality of life from pre- to post-treatment. Broader outcomescontinue to improve or endure through follow-up. In summary,
ACT and CBT resulted in significant improvements from pre- topost-treatment that were maintained or improved upon duringTable 4

aWe did not compute separate means or standard deviations for specific phobia participants because of their low numbers ( n/H110056).bThese represent the
mean and standard deviation for participants with data at each assessment point.cFor ease of comparison with full-sample data reported in Table 3, we
employed the standard deviation from the entire sample as the denominator in the Feingold (2009) effect size magnitude formula. This resulted in some what
more conservative (lower) effect sizes for some measures. Further, slopes are based on change over time with all assessment points in the model (Prethrough 12mFU). Therefore, effect sizes from Pre to Post reflect the slope of change across all assessment points which can differ from the slope of Preto Post change alone.760 ARCH ET AL.

follow-up, on both anxiety-specific and broader outcomes. Further,
improvements were evident across two different dimensions oftreatment response, namely, more objective, clinician-rated CSRoutcomes as well as subjective, patient-rated self-report outcomes.
From the end of treatment through the 12-month follow-up,
several noteworthy group differences emerged. On anxiety-specific outcomes, ACT demonstrated a steeper linear improve-ment rate than CBT in the principal disorder severity rating, adifference of large effect size. ACT’s steeper improvement ratesresulted in lower principal disorder severity ratings than CBT atthe 12-month follow-up, again of large effect size, although sta-tistically significant effects were limited to the completer sample.Over the long term, therefore, ACT more effectively reducedprincipal anxiety disorder severity than CBT among those who
completed treatment. This finding is consistent with a previousstudy (Lappalainen et al., 2007) that found that ACT resulted inmore symptom improvement that CBT, albeit in a much smallersample ( n/H1100528) of unselected outpatients. However, since more
ACT than CBT patients in the current study utilized outsidetherapy during the initial follow-up interval, we cannot fully de-termine whether ACT’s superiority resulted from the ACT treat-ment alone or ACT plus additional psychotherapy. Excludingpatients using non-study therapy from the principal disorder se-verity analyses, however, did not change the pattern of results,suggesting that use of non-study therapy did not influence theprincipal disorder severity findings.
For broader outcomes, one unexpected finding was that CBT
participants reported significantly higher quality of life than ACTat 12-month follow-up, a difference of moderate effect size. It hadbeen hypothesized that the explicit focus on valued living in ACTwould lead to greater improvements in quality of life. Conceiv-ably, our measure of quality of life was too general to capturevalues-specific improvements. Consistent with hypotheses, how-ever, ACT participants reported higher levels of psychologicalflexibility than CBT at 12-month follow-up on a measure specif-ically designed to capture ACT-related improvement (Hayes et al.,2004). Please refer to the supplemental materials for further dis-cussion of primary outcomes.
Finally, ACT and CBT produced similar rates of reliable change,
diagnostic improvement, and high end-state functioning, comparableto our recent review showing that on average the mean response ratefor CBT across anxiety disorder studies from 2000–2011 was 51.36%at post-treatment (180 studies) and 54.80% at follow-up (71 studies;Loerinc, Meuret, Twohig, Rosenfield, & Craske, 2012). Very fewstudies (of the 180) used reliable change index methods to computetreatment response rates, but the few that did (e.g., Addis et al., 2004;Carter, Sbrocco, Gore, Marin, & Lewis, 2003) evidenced responserates comparable to those in the present study.
Secondary Outcomes
As noted above, more ACT than CBT patients reported non-study
psychotherapy (new or continued psychotherapy) at the 6-monthfollow-up assessment, although there were no group differences in theinitiation of new psychotherapy during this period nor in medicationuse, nor any group differences on these variables at 12-month follow-up. Reasons for this group difference, nonetheless, were explored.The data showed some support for the notion that ACT patients whoremained distressed following treatment were more likely to seekadditional psychotherapy than CBT patients who remained distressed.Another possibility is that the broader focus on exploring personalvalues, pursuing meaningful life behaviors, and contacting the fullrange of emotions in ACT inspired patients to continue engaging inpsychotherapy.
Both ACT and CBT resulted in robust reductions in co-occurring
mood and anxiety disorders. This finding demonstrates that treatmenteffects generalized in both groups, replicating and extending previouswork on the broader effects of CBT for panic disorder and generalizedanxiety disorder (e.g., Borkovec, Abel, & Newman, 1995; Tsao,Mystkowski, Zucker, & Craske, 2005).A.

Treatment and Therapist Variables
Attrition rates were relatively high across both ACT and CBT;
however, no group differences emerged. Attrition was comparableto some large trials of CBT for anxiety disorders (e.g., Barlow etal., 2000) but was higher than the mean attrition (23%) reported ina meta-analysis of CBT studies for anxiety disorders (Hofmann &Smits, 2008). Although attrition reasons for many patients remainunknown, we suspect that four features of our study may havecontributed to attrition. First, the study took place in a difficult tolocate, high-traffic, parking-challenged clinic with limited publictransportation options, and travel times to and from treatment often
exceeded 45 min each way. Second, our assessments included a 2-to 3-hr physiological laboratory session that was strongly anxietyprovoking for many patients (e.g., involving hyperventilation, neg-ative picture slide viewing), which may have discouraged patientsfrom study completion. Third, unlike many studies where treat-ment is free or low cost for all, most patients paid for treatment andincurred significant parking costs. Fourth, we offered few incen-tives for treatment completion and failed to sufficiently incentivizepost-treatment and follow-up assessment completion. Higher in-Table 5

centives may have been particularly needed in a study with such
significant treatment barriers (e.g., long travel times, parking feesand difficulties, treatment fees).
An important finding to emerge from blind treatment integrity
ratings was that ACT and CBT were clearly distinguished fromone another and that therapists strongly adhered to their designatedtreatment. Despite the use of novice student therapists, therapistsaveraged “good” overall skills across both treatments with nodifferences between treatment groups. Therapists treating patientsin both CBT and ACT nonetheless evidenced significantly highercompetence than therapists treating in CBT only. Principal diag-nostic severity analyses of patients treated only by “both-type”therapists showed the same pattern of outcomes, however, sug-gesting that these differences did not impact overall study findings.
Early in treatment, CBT was rated as a more credible treatment
than ACT by a medium effect size. Thus, ACT therapists were notas successful as CBT therapists in convincing patients early on thatthey offered a credible treatment. This difference did not appear toinfluence attrition rates, which did not differ by group. Conceiv-ably, abstract ideas of acceptance and creative hopelessness ininitial ACT sessions (rather than concrete skills in CBT) contrib-uted to a diminished sense of treatment credibility. Future studiesshould assess treatment credibility regularly throughout ACT todetermine whether ACT follows a delayed trajectory in convincingpatients that it offers something credible, or whether ACT patientsremain skeptical throughout treatment but improve anyway. Thelatter would suggest that treatment credibility is relatively unim-portant to the success of ACT. Certainly, in the current study, thelowered credibility ratings relative to CBT did not appear todisadvantage ACT outcomes relative to CBT outcomes.
Study Limitations
Several study limitations should be noted. First, our mixed
anxiety disorder sample limits the conclusions that may be drawnabout any single anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders typicallyco-occur at high rates with other anxiety disorders and share manycommon features (see Barlow, 2002; Craske et al., 2009), how-ever, strengthening the ecological validity of this approach. Sec-ond, relatively high attrition rates may have resulted in underesti-mated treatment effects or compromised ability to accuratelyassess treatment-related improvements in the ITT sample. On theother hand, we utilized a sophisticated statistical approach (HLM,HMLM) that utilized patients with incomplete data and drew uponall available data in the ITT analyses; we also conducted separatecompleters analyses. Third, we did not assess therapist allegiance,which may have impacted treatment results given that the studywas conducted within a CBT-renowned research clinic. Based onthe relatively inexperienced and junior nature of the therapists,however, allegiance is unlikely to be a significant factor. Therapistexperience raises another limitation, which is that the results maydiffer in the hands of more experienced therapists. Fourth, CBTsupervision was conducted onsite in a face-to-face manner,whereas most ACT supervision was conducted via phone or Skypewith offsite supervisors. We did not assess supervision quality andthus could not investigate the impact of this group difference.Fifth, we did not systematically assess reasons for attrition and,thus, could not assess whether ACT and CBT differed in the extentto which patients dropped out because they were unsatisfied withtreatment. Future ACT/CBT studies should assess group differ-
ences in stated reasons for attrition. Sixth, we utilized a single-itemrating from the Fear Questionnaire for behavioral avoidance due tothe lack of avoidance measures relevant to all anxiety disorders.Seventh, we used a website to generate the randomization se-quence, whereas use of an external agency would have beenpreferable. Eighth, we did not include a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control group, which may have obscured our capacity toassess improvement due to treatment versus the passage of time. Ithas been argued, however, that comparing a newer to a well-established treatment does not require a no-treatment or waitlistcontrol group and is more ethical without one (Kazdin, 2002).Also, the roughly equal number of treatment sessions devoted tobehavioral exposure in ACT and CBT may have obscured treat-ment differences. The two treatment conditions were matched onexposure, albeit framed with different intents, given the potency ofexposure as a change agent. This feature may have altered the waythat ACT is typically done. In addition, the Penn State WorryQuestionnaire scores at pre-treatment in the GAD subsample wereconsiderably lower than those in recently published randomizedtrials for GAD (Newman et al., 2011; Roemer et al., 2008), whichmay hold implications for the interpretation of findings in thissubgroup. Finally, regarding the generalizability of our findings,our sample largely reflected the racial, ethnic, and sex distributionof U.S. residents at the time of data collection (U.S. CensusBureau, 2012), supporting the broad generalizability of our find-ings. On the other hand, our sample was relatively educated (theaverage participant had completed 3.5 years of college), and thus,our findings may not generalize to less educated samples. Further,we cannot assume that treatment was equally efficacious acrossracial subgroups because we lacked the statistical power to exam-ine whether outcomes differed by race. This remains an importantquestion for future research.
Summary and Conclusion
To our knowledge, this study represents the first randomized clin-
ical trial comparing ACT and CBT for anxiety disorders. Despitedifferences in underlying treatment models, the overall findings arecharacterized by similarities in the immediate and long-term impact ofboth treatments. We have argued elsewhere (Arch & Craske, 2008)that ACT and CBT for anxiety disorders may represent differentapproaches to affecting common therapeutic changes. This studylargely supports this hypothesis. On the other hand, some differencesdid emerge, in that CBT resulted in higher quality of life, whereasACT resulted in greater psychological flexibility, and, among thosewho completed treatment, lower principal anxiety disorder severity,over the follow-up. Overall, our findings suggest that ACT is a highlyviable treatment alternative to CBT, the current gold-standard psy-chosocial treatment for anxiety disorders. Further, they pave the wayfor future investigations of for whom each treatment approach is mosteffective and the shared versus unique mechanisms of therapeuticchange.

The current sexual offender literature focuses on recidivism reduction in an effort to
increase public safety. While cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs are considered a
mainstream treatment method, it is essential to study recidivism as an indicator of treatment
effectiveness. This meta-analysis examines research published since 1970 to determine the
overall effectiveness of treatments in reducing recidivism among adult male sexual
offenders. Decade of implementation and CBT treatment features are also assessed asmoderator variables. The results from the 25 studies identified were converted into 42
weighted effect sizes utilizing a random-effects model. Significant overall effect sizes were
found for sexual and violent/combination recidivism; however, multiple indices indicate
heterogeneity in the effect sizes. Significant differences were found in the overall
effectiveness of the treatments by decade, and the treatments delivered during the 1990swere found to be related to lower levels of sexual and violent/combination recidivism.
Key words: adult male sexual offender treatment; cognitive-behavioral therapy; males;
meta-analysis; sexual offender; recidivism; sex offender treatment effectiveness; sexoffender treatment efficacy; treatment effectiveness; treatment efficacy.
Historically, sexual offending has been con-
sidered a serious social issue due to both the
lasting negative impact it has on many of its
victims and the concern of public safety forthose in the community. These important
social issues were at the heart of the initial
approach to sexual offender treatment takenby clinical specialists. While sexualoffenders are stigmatized by many groups
(e.g., law enforcement, the media, the com-
munity, non-sexual offenders), they are also
continually degraded through general discus-sion, research focus and paper titles (Brown,
1999). As a result, the concept of sexual
offender treatment as a service offered tothis particular offender population is

regarded as controversial (Griffin &
West, 2006).
As sexual offenders can be convicted for a
range of different crimes, convictions and sen-tences are largely contingent upon the individ-ual and the nature of his or her offense. As
such, several approaches are generally utilized
to treat sexual offenders. Some of these treat-ment contexts may include community-basedsentencing alternatives, prison treatment pro-
grams, parole and probation treatment pro-
grams and sexual predator programs that areprovided to those who are civilly committed(La Fond, 2005).
The history of sexual offender treatment
The first documented attempts at treating sexu-
ally deviant behavior occurred around the latenineteenth century (Laws & Marshall, 2003).
Of these attempts, two broad treatment
approaches emerged: psychological (i.e.,assisting offenders to change how they thinkand act, and teaching them how to avoid com-mitting sex crimes) and medical (i.e., methods
such as surgical or chemical castration used to
diminish libido; see La Fond, 2005). As the
field has evolved, the 1970s has come to beviewed as the advent of the modern era of sex-
ual offender treatment. At that time, several
important contributions to the field emerged,including the further development of phallo-metric evaluations, the broadening of behav-ioral interventions and the first descriptions of
more comprehensive treatment programs
(Marshall & Laws, 2003).
In the 1980s, one of the most significant
contributions was the adaptation and use of the
relapse prevention model from the addiction
field. Researchers began to identify common-alities between addictive behaviors and sexualaggression, especially in terms of their associ-ation with signs of relapse (Marlatt & Gordon,
1985). More specifically, the relapse preven-
tion piece assists the male offender in identify-ing problematic situations that may place himat risk for reoffending, teaches strategies tohelp him cope with these high-risk situations
and helps him to gain control over his sexual
behavior (Nelson, Miner, Marques, Russell, &Achterkirchen, 1989).
Throughout the 1990s more treatment pro-
grams became available worldwide, andresearch and publications became more preva-lent. With the concept of integrative treatment
models surfacing, many researchers came to
collectively understand that the previously for-mulated theories (e.g., biological, environmen-
tal, social learning, behavioral, cognitive, etc.)
were too simplistic to conceptualize sexualoffending as the result of actions in only one
domain. This led to the development of com-
prehensive approaches that integrate multipletheories of sexual offending by combining the
physiological, psychological, social and envir-
onmental influences on the development andmaintenance of sexual offending behaviors.As such, treatments are much more extensive
and target many areas, including deviant sex-
ual arousal, distorted cognition, pro-offendingattitudes, problems with impulse control,
social skills deficits, poor emotion regulation
and environmental triggers (Marshall,Anderson, & Fernandez, 1999). In fact, multi-
component cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) that incorporates relapse preventionwas the preferred treatment modality for sex-
ual offenders during the 1970s and remains
predominant today (Marshall, 1999).
The most prevalent development accom-
panying the turn of the century was the
increase in research on treatment effectiveness.
Some of the first meta-analyses surfaced, pro-viding interesting findings with significant
clinical implications for working with this
population. Over the many decades that sexual
offender treatment has evolved, both psycho-
logical and medical approaches to treatmenthave been extensively researched (Marshall &
Laws, 2003). As a result, a variety of different
therapeutic modalities and treatment goals –
primarily within psychological treatment
approaches –have surfaced in response to ris-
ing etiological theories attempting to explain
sexual offending behaviors.2 J. L. Harrison et al.
As treatment options have continued to
expand, a more integrative approach has devel-
oped that involves focusing on both cognitionand behavior in order to seek change. As such,
the most common and mainstream form of
treatment available for sexual offenders acrossthe United States (US) and Europe is CBT.
This approach to treatment seeks a much more
comprehensive conceptualization of sexual
offending which incorporates physiological,
psychological, social and environmental influ-ences on the development and maintenance of
sexual offending behaviors (Kirsch & Becker,
2006). A large body of research continues to
accumulate that further demonstrates CBT ’s
effectiveness as a mainstream treatment for
sexual offenders (Alexander, 1999; Furby,
Weinrott, & Blackshaw, 1989;G a l l a g h e r ,
Wilson, Hirschfield, Coggeshall, &MacKenzie, 1999; Hall, 1995;H a n s o ne ta l . ,
2002;L€osel & Schmucker, 2005;Q u i n n ,
Forsyth, & Mullen-Quinn, 2004).
Most of the research available to date on
the sexual offender population consists of
male sexual offenders. Consequently, sexualoffending is generally considered a male phe-
nomenon (Wijkman, Bijleveld, & Hendriks,
2010). As such, this leads many to state that in
academic research, female perpetrators of sex-
ual offenses are ignored (Grayston & De Luca,1999). While the true prevalence of sexual
abuse is currently unknown for sexual
offenders, a meta-analysis conducted byCortoni (2009) found that female sexual
offenders represent about 5% of the sexual
offender population. Although there are far
less female sexual offenders than males, this
figure is still evidentiary support that womenare indeed capable of committing such
offenses. Of the statistics available to date,
these data strongly suggest that men still con-stitute the majority of sexual abuse offenders
(Wijkman et al., 2010). A full literature review
was completed relevant to female sexualoffenders; however, it was not deemed rele-
vant to this paper, and can be obtained by con-
tacting the corresponding author.Measuring treatment effectiveness
Even though sexual offender treatment is con-
sidered an established clinical specialty, evi-dence concerning its effectiveness has been
rather slow to accumulate. In addition, treat-
ment effectiveness has yet to be conclusivelydemonstrated (Harkins & Beech, 2007). As
such, the question of whether or not sexual
offender treatment works is a prime subject ofdebate within this field. Much of these con-cerns arise from the fact that relatively few
well-designed studies of treatment efficacy
have been conducted.
Historically, treatment evaluation research
has not been of high quality. The initial efforts
dedicated to the investigation of treatmenteffectiveness with sexual offenders did not
yield promising results. In fact, some of these
results contributed to the idea that sexualoffender treatment is a waste of time and fund-
ing (Furby et al., 1989). Because some of these
early studies do not even describe the subjectsor the treatment approach utilized, the effects
of treatment were difficult to evaluate. In some
studies, the treatment groups were fundamen-tally different from the control groups that didnot receive treatment. Furthermore, outcome
studies typically relied on only one measure of
outcome, notably recidivism data derived fromofficial sources, such as probation, parole and
arrest records (Washington State Institute for
Public Policy, 1991).
Despite these initial problems, there is
now a considerable body of research within
the field that shows evidence of effectivenessspecific to the cognitive-behavioral modality
of treatment (Marshall & Barbaree, 1990;
Quinn et al., 2004). Many other studies within
the field have concluded that offering CBT-based treatment to sexual offenders reduces
reoffending (Alexander, 1999; Furby et al.,
1989
;G a l l a g h e re ta l . , 1999;H a l l , 1995;
Hanson et al., 2002;L€osel & Schmucker,
2005). Furthermore, treatment models follow-
ing cognitive-behavioral and relapse preven-tion techniques are the most effective, andSexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 3
long-term follow-up increases the level of
effectiveness (Quinn et al., 2004).
While there are several ways of measuring
treatment effectiveness, there remains consid-erable debate surrounding which methods touse. Some believe that only the most scientif-
ically rigorous techniques should be used if
one hopes to be able to draw meaningful con-clusions (Rice & Harris, 2003). On the other
hand, others feel that less stringent criteria per-
t a i n i n gt oc o n t r o lg r o u p sm a yb eu t i l i z e dt o
yield meaningful inferential results (Marshallet al., 1999).
Review of existing meta-analyses
The treatment-effectiveness literature on the
sexual offender population has been slowlyaccumulating since the 1980s. In fact, one ofthe first reviews –conducted by Furby et al.
(1989)–examines qualitative trends and
patterns across studies in lieu of utilizingmeta-analytic methods. The authors identify apattern wherein the longer the follow-upperiod, the greater the percentage of men who
will have committed another crime in the
interim. In addition, they found no evidencethat clinical treatment reduces rates of sexualreoffending in general. On the other hand, they
did find some evidence that recidivism
rates may be different for different types ofoffenders. From their initial review, theauthors posited that progress in knowledgeabout sexual offender recidivism would con-
tinually elude those in the professional realm
until adequate resources of time, money andresearch expertise were devoted to exploringthe matter (Furby et al., 1989). Following this
well-known review, more treatment effective-
ness studies began to accumulate. Several
meta-analyses with seminal results relevant tothis body of literature are reviewed below.
Hall ( 1995) produced one of the first well-
known meta-analyses conducted on sexual
offender treatment, reviewing 12 studies andfinding a small but robust effect size whentreatment was compared to control conditions.In general, the treatment effects are largest
in samples with high base rates of recidivism.
The institutionalized samples show asmall effect size for treatment whereas amedium effect size was found for treatment
in studies of outpatient samples. While cogni-
tive-behavioral and hormonal treatmentsappear to be superior to behavioral treatments,medium effect sizes were found for both but
are not significantly different in their effective-
ness in preventing recidivism. More specific-ally, the mean treatment effect size for studies
with follow-up periods of greater than five
years is significantly greater than the meantreatment effect of those with periods of lessthan five years (Hall, 1995). Thus, effective
treatments may influence the recidivism curve
to be asymptotic (tending toward zero) afterfive years following treatment, whereas the
effects of less effective treatments may wear
off within five years.
According to a meta-analysis of 61 studies
conducted by Hanson and Bussi /C18ere ( 1998),
offenders who fail to complete treatment are at
increased risk for both sexual and generalrecidivism. An alternative explanation to this
finding is that high-risk offenders are the most
likely to quit or be removed from treatment.Although this meta-analytical review does notdirectly examine treatment effectiveness, the
authors posit that treatment programs can con-
tribute to community safety through their abil-ity to monitor risk. Even if treatment
effectiveness cannot be asserted, Hanson and
Bussi /C18ere (1998) reiterate that there is reliable
evidence that the offenders who attend andcooperate with treatment are less likely to
reoffend than those who reject treatment.
Polizzi, MacKenzie, and Hickman ’s
(1999) meta-analysis of 21 studies found that
non-prison-based sexual offender treatment
programs using cognitive-behavioral treatmentmethods are effective in reducing the sexualoffense recidivism rates of sexual offenders.
While eight studies were deemed too lacking
in scientific merit to include within the ana-lysis, the remaining studies were found to4 J. L. Harrison et al.
show approximately 50% statistically signifi-
cant findings in favor of sexual offender treat-
ment programs. Furthermore, of the six studies
showing a positive treatment effect, four incor-porated a cognitive-behavioral approach totreatment. Overall, Polizzi et al. ( 1999)c o n -
cluded that non-prison-based sexual offender
treatment programs were effective in reducing
recidivism among sexual offenders, but thatthere was not enough evidentiary support toconfirm the effectiveness of prison-based programs.

and a total of more than 9,000 offenders.Similar to Hall ( 1995)a n dG a l l a g h e re ta l .
(1999), Hanson et al. found the sexual offense
recidivism rate to be lower across the treat-
ment groups (12.3%) than the comparison
groups (16.8%) in 38 studies. A similar patternwas found in 30 studies for general recidivismfor both the treatment (27.9%) and comparison(39.2%) groups. In addition, those whodropped out of treatment had consistently
higher sexual recidivism rates than those who
completed treatment (with an Odds Ratio(OR) of 0.47; Hanson et al., 2002).
Hanson and Morton-Bourgon ( 2005)
examined 82 studies and found that most sex-
ual offenders are not caught for another sexualoffense, and are more likely to recidivate witha non-sexual offense (with an overall recidiv-ism rate of 36.2%). The observed sexual recid-ivism rate was found to be 13.7%. Also within
this analysis, the authors examined predictors
of sexual recidivism and found sexual devi-ancy and antisocial orientation to be the high-est for both adult and adolescent sexualoffenders. Further, it should be noted that
many of the variables used within clinical
assessments are found to have little or no rela-tionship with recidivism, such as denial, lowvictim empathy and low motivation for treat-ment (Hanson & Morton-Bourgon, 2005).
L€osel and Schmucker ( 2005) examined 69
studies totaling more than 22,000 offendersbetween the treatment and control groups.This is currently the most comprehensivedatabase available on sexual offender treat-
ment outcomes. The authors found that treated
offenders have lower sexual recidivism rates(11.1%) than controls (17.5%). Another inter-esting find is that organic treatments, notably
surgical castration and hormonal medication,
show larger effects than psychosocial inter-ventions. Finally, among the psychologicalprograms reviewed, cognitive-behavioral
approaches reveal the most robust effect
(L€osel & Schmucker, 2005).
Doren and Yates ’s(2008) meta-analysis of
10 studies presents two potentially meaningful
conclusions regarding the effectiveness oftreatment on psychopathic sexual offenders.First, they conclude that sexual offender treat-
ment does not appear to be effective in lower-
ing serious recidivism rates for psychopaths tolevels demonstrated by non-psychopaths.
Second, while treated psychopaths ’sexual
recidivism rates relative to non-psychopaths ’
rates are variable, there are repeated indica-tions that some psychopaths show the same
sexual recidivism rates as non-psychopaths
following treatment, whereas others do not. Itshould be noted that within this meta-analysis,
the authors included studies that did not have
untreated comparison groups. As such, no con-clusions emerge concerning the degree towhich psychopathic offenders benefit from
sexual offender treatment, as the lack of com-
parison groups resulted in simple correlationalfindings rather than tests of significance
between experimental conditions (Doren &
Yates, 2008).
Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, and Hodgson
(2009) conducted a review of 22 studies exam-
ining over 6,000 offenders and found that
those offenders within the treatment groupdemonstrated lower sexual recidivism rates
(10.9%) than those in the comparison groups
(19.2%). Another interesting finding is thatrecent treatment showed stronger treatmenteffects than older treatments, as the starting
date for treatment ranged between 1965 and
1997. Through examining both adolescent andadult sexual offenders within this review, theSexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 5
authors also identified similar overall treat-
ment effects, with only minor differences in
the general recidivism rates (Hanson
et al., 2009).
The purpose of the present study is to con-
duct a comprehensive update research synthe-
sis on sexual, general and violent recidivism
variables and the effectiveness of adult male
sexual offender treatment using the statistical
technique of meta-analysis. Further, this meta-
analysis aims to identify significant variables
that may impact treatment effectiveness,
examining studies from the 1970s onward to
capture all relevant studies since CBT ’si n c e p -
tion within the field of sexual offender treat-
ment. To the authors ’knowledge, this is the
first meta-analysis to examine disparate meth-
ods of treatment effectiveness where CBT is
used exclusively to treat adult male sex-
ual offenders.
Method
Data collectionThis meta-analysis examines the relationship
between treatment effectiveness and recidiv-
ism among adult male sexual offenders. An
extensive literature search of the EbscoHOSTdatabase was conducted, encompassing a total
of 29 electronic databases (e.g., PsycINFO,
Medline; for details, see Appendix ). Studies
were selected using the search terms (sex/C3)
AND (offend/C3)A N D( t r e a t/C3) AND (effect/C3)
AND (recid/C3) NOT (child/C3OR adolesc/C3OR
fem/C3). In addition, a time-frame delimiter of
searching for articles published in 1970 or later
was incorporated due to the inception of CBT
within sexual offender treatment programs as
early as 1970. The reference lists of the
reviewed studies were also examined in order
to identify any additional studies not found inthe initial search. The researchers reviewed
each study to determine whether or not it eval-
uated treatment effectiveness, defined as recid-
ivism. The following exclusion criteria codes
were utilized at the abstract level to eliminate
studies that would not ultimately meetinclusion criteria at the full-text level: (a)
NRS: Not Research, (b) NR: No Recidivism,(c) NE: Not English, (d) J: Adolescents, (e) F:Females, (f) DD: Developmentally Delayed,(g) TX: Issues with Treatment, (h) PSY: NotPsychotherapy, (i) SMI: Severely Mentally Ill
and (j) RP: Repeat Data.
For a study to be included, it was required
to define recidivism as violation of parole,
readmittance to institutions, rearrest, reconvic-
tion, lapses in behavior (such as willfully andelaborately fantasizing about sexual offendingor engaging in any sources of stimulation asso-ciated with sexual offending) or any combin-ation of the aforementioned after treatmentconcluded. Recidivism rates were attained
from a variety of sources, including probation,
parole records and officer reports, publicrecords (e.g., National Criminal Justicerecords, state and provincial records) and add-itional sources such as child protection recordsand self-reports. In order to successfullyimplement a rigorous methodology in the pre-
sent meta-analysis, existing meta-analyses
were reviewed with the aim of annotating theirlimitations and pitfalls. The following limita-tions of previous studies were noted: no use ofa control or comparison group; inclusion ofmultiple sexual offender populations (e.g.,females, males, adolescents, severely mentally
ill, developmentally delayed); unspecified or
widely varying definitions of recidivism; useof solely intention-to-treat or per-protocol ana-lysis; and overlapping participant samples. Assuch, these were used to inform the inclusionand exclusion criteria.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Measures of treatment effectiveness
The studies must utilize treatments for adult
male sexual offenders in either a communityor an institutionalized setting and compare thesexual recidivism rates of a treated sexualoffender sample with a comparison group ofsexual offenders. Therefore, studies that report
only general recidivism or violence recidivism
are not eligible. Similar recidivism criteria6 J. L. Harrison et al.
must be used for both the treatment and the
comparison groups, and the recidivism rates
must be reported for comparable follow-upperiods. The sexual offender treatment pro-
grams must include at least 10 offenders (5
offenders per group) in the combined sample,and the programs must provide CBT treatment.Studies utilizing alternative therapeutic modal-
ities (e.g., psychodynamic therapy, humanistic
therapy, etc.) or various forms of medicationor hormonal therapy are not eligible.
Research respondents
The studies must be comprised of only adult
male sexual offenders (aged 18 to 75 years) astreatment and comparison participants. Studies
that include female or adolescent sexual
offenders are not eligible. Any studies whichindicate that the participants suffered from sig-
nificant mental health problems or were devel-
opmentally delayed are also ineligible.
Research design
The studies must apply a control or compari-
son group design. The control condition can
consist of receiving standard treatment, being
on a waiting list, participating in a treatmentprogram that is not specific to sexual offenders
or receiving no treatment. Studies that utilize
random assignment, incidental assignment, ini-tial group differences upon statistical review
or matched subjects are eligible. However,
studies that use matched subjects must matchon criteria relevant to the particular goals of
the present meta-analysis.
Cultural and linguistic range
The studies must be conducted in an English-
speaking country and the data must beaccounted for and reported in the English lan-
guage. Given that the sexual offender popula-
tion may vary culturally, the inclusion ofsexual offender studies from other cultures
could have introduced an unaccounted for
source of variance and bias into themeta-analysis.Time frame
The studies must be conducted from 1970
onwards. This criterion restricts the meta-ana-lysis to only the most current studies, as wellas the effectiveness studies surrounding CBT-based treatment that have contributed to themajority of the existent mainstream sexualoffender literature.
Publication type
Published and unpublished studies are eligible
for inclusion, including refereed and non-refer-eed journal articles, dissertations, theses andgovernment reports. As the purpose of thismeta-analysis is to provide an updated examin-ation of the treatment effects of CBT-basedsexual offender programs, all eligible studiesare considered so qualified, irrespective oftheir current publication status.
Analytical method
Coding of the variablesA subject-specific manual was utilized to code
the studies. The coding variables include bib-liographic information (e.g., year and type ofpublication), sample descriptors (e.g., meanage, predominant race, treatment setting),research design descriptors (e.g., treatmentcondition, sample frequency data), nature oftreatment descriptors (e.g., type and orientationof treatment) and dependent measure descrip-tors (recidivism data and source). While alarge volume of variables were coded, onlythose evidencing enough variability wereincluded in the analysis. In an effort to ensureinterrater reliability, three graduate studentswith similar coding training evaluated thestudies using a blind method of coding thatfollowed the guidelines set forth bythe manual.
Computation of the effect sizes
In order to calculate the effect sizes of the
recidivism rates, the primary statistics usedwere the frequency or proportion data. In theSexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 7
event that frequencies and proportions either
were not reported or could not be estimated,
the effect size could not be calculated and the
study was excluded from the meta-analysis.
Odds ratios were computed as effect sizes
from the frequency and proportion data.
However, odds ratios are asymmetric and have
a complex standard error formula, so all
odds ratios were converted to their natural
l o gf o ra n a l y s e sa n dt h e nt h er e s u l t sw e r e
converted back into odds ratios to facilitate
better understanding. All effect sizes and
analyses were calculated using the software
program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis(Biostat, 2005).
Heterogeneity
In order to properly evaluate the study ’s homo-
geneity, the Qstatistic was calculated. In add-
ition, the statistical heterogeneity was measured
using the I
2statistic as an estimation of the
variation across studies due to true heterogen-
eity rather than chance. I2values of 25% are
considered low, while 50% is considered mod-
erate and 75% is considered high (Higgins,
Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). Statistical
heterogeneity was identified from overall treat-
ment effects of sexual, general and violent/
combination recidivism. As various differences
among treatment programs were considered to
be a source of potential heterogeneity, a variety
of moderator variables were assessed in an
attempt to explain any excessive variation
found within the random-effects models. If all
the CBT-based sexual-offender treatments
administered were similar in nature, a small
between-treatments effect size and low levels
of heterogeneity would be found.
Moderator analyses
In order to evaluate the outcome differences in
recidivism between treatment settings, follow-
up periods, CBT treatment features and decade
of implementation, a moderator comparison
analysis was warranted. The following moder-
ator analyses of distal outcome differences
were conducted: (a) institution versuscommunity treatment settings, (b) short-term
versus long-term follow-up, (c) programs that
utilize relapse prevention versus programs that
utilize a combination of CBT treatment featuresand (d) decade of implementation. The moder-
ator analyses permitted two or more subgroups
of studies to be compared. The mean effect sizewas calculated for each moderator, and a test of
heterogeneity was then conducted to examine
whether or not the effect sizes vary signifi-
cantly from one another. Variation between
moderators indicates a difference in recidivismrates across studies. Given the high likelihood
of variability between and within each study
included, all moderator analyses were con-
ducted in a random-effects model that attributes
a portion of the variability to factors other thansampling error.
The impact of these sources of heterogen-
eity was explored using moderator analyses
for each overall effect size for sexual, general
and violent/combination recidivism. The varia-
bles explored include the treatment mandate,
epidemiology, treatment setting, decade ofimplementation, CBT treatment features, ther-
apy form (group, individual or both) and fol-
low-up period. However, these variables were
only explored within grand mean effect sizes
that evidence significant heterogeneity as apossible explanation of variation. Furthermore,
only those variables that exhibit significant
variation across the studies could be explored.
Additionally, the possibility of publication
bias was assessed through a funnel plot andtested for asymmetry using Duval and
Tweedie ’s(2000) trim and fill procedure. Both
classic and Orwin ’sf a i l - s a f e Ns( O r w i n , 1983)
were computed for each effect size to deter-
mine the number of studies that it would take
to nullify the results found.
Interrater reliability
Overall, the researchers achieved an agreement
of 90%. Cicchetti ( 1994) defines interrater
concordance rates with the following ranges:
( 1 )p o o ra g r e e m e n ti s <.40, (2) fair agreement
is .41 to .59, (3) good agreement is .60 to .748 J. L. Harrison et al.
and (4) excellent agreement is .75 to 1.00. The
overall concordance rate achieved excellent
agreement. When coding differences were pre-
sent, researchers met and resolved discrepan-
cies until final agreement was reached.
Results
Descriptive characteristics
A total of 12,811 sexual offenders participated
in the 25 studies included in the meta-analysis
(Table 1 ). The sexual offenders ’mean age
across studies is 37.69 years, with approxi-
mately 56% of the entire sample characterizedas a mix of offense type, such as child
molesters and pedophiles, exhibitionists, rap-
ists and sexual offenders who committed sex-
ual assault ( Table 2 ). Most studies were
c o n d u c t e di nt h eU S ,w i t ho t h e r sb a s e di n
Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom
(UK). Approximately one fourth containunpublished data. While approximately one
fifth were published in the 1990s, more than
three quarters of the studies were published
from the 2000s onward ( Table 3 ). However, as
the treatment characteristics demonstrate, the
actual treatment implementation began much
earlier for many of the programs.
Seventeen of the studies included were
of institutional treatment programs, within
either a prison or a hospital setting, and the
remaining eight were conducted within com-
munity-based settings. These studies examine
the effectiveness of CBT-based treatment pro-
grams for sexual offenders in reducing general
sexual and violent/combination recidivism
rates. As many studies report multiple types ofrecidivism, a total of 42 effect sizes were cal-
culated. In addition, within-treatment changes
were examined, including core treatment goals
of sexual deviancy, offense responsibility,
empathy and problem-solving; however, not
enough data were present to analyze these
proximal treatment variables.
The treatment programs vary in the type
of CBT offered, including individual, group
and a combination of the aforementionedtreatment methods. Overall, the treatment time
varies from 3 months to 3 years and the fol-
low-up periods range from 9 months to over10 years. Most of the institutionalized treat-ment programs recruited participants through
mandated participation, but some utilized ini-
tial screening, including the evaluation ofamenability to treatment. All the community-based studies were mandated as part of condi-
tional release, and recruited participants
through parole or probation officers ( Table 4 ).
Most of the studies utilize similar exclusion
criteria, such as disqualifying any participant
who denied having committed a sexualoffense. In addition, many studies disqualifiedoffenders who suffered from significant psy-
chopathology. All the studies focus on adult
male sexual offenders, and none include anyfemales or adolescents.
The majority of the 25 studies included
in this meta-analysis report various forms ofrecidivism, including general, sexual, violentor a combination. The studies also vary
with respect to the manner in which recid-
ivism is defined. Recidivism was recordedafter an average follow-up period of five
years, and is largely based on data gathered
from official criminal police records. Themost common definition of recidivism isreconviction, followed by a combination of
conviction, arrest and charges, then rearrest
and finally recharge alone. In one study,recidivism is defined loosely as lapse
behavior ( Table 5 ).
The sample sizes for the treatment and
control groups range from six to 1,910.Approximately one sixth of the studies
includes fewer than 100 offenders. Only one
study is based on a randomized design, whilefour use matched subjects and the remaining
20 utilize incidental assignment. Intention-to-
treat analysis is used in 10 studies, and theother 15 utilize per-protocol analysis to deter-mine epidemiology of treatment. In addition,
the therapists that administered the treatment
in most of the studies were either trained forthe specific intervention or trained in theSexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 9

Analysis of sexual recidivism
Scope and overall effect size
All odds ratios, confidence intervals and het-
erogeneity statistics were computed using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Biostat, 2005).All values were kept at their original compu-
tation, accurate to the third decimal place, in
order to facilitate a meaningful interpretation
of the results. A total of 19 of the 25 studies
report sexual recidivism rates and were ana-
lyzed for treatment effectiveness specific tosexual recidivism. The overall odds ratio for
sexual recidivism is 0.639, with a 95% confi-
dence interval ranging from 0.473 to 0.861Table 2. Frequencies and percentages of offender mean age, type of offender and vio-

(Table 6 andFigure 1 ). Odds ratios are inter-
preted differently from many other forms oftreatment effect sizes. Values greater than
1.0 illustrate an increase in recidivistic
behavior and thus a decrease in treatmenteffectiveness, whereas values less than 1.0indicate a decrease in recidivistic behaviorand thus an increase in treatment effective-
ness. Odds ratios near 1.0 demonstrate that
there was no change in behavior and ultim-ately no treatment effect. Although theoverall finding for sexual recidivism demon-
strates that the treatment had a significant
effect, it is important to look for significantvariation in the size of the treatment effect
across the studies.
Heterogeneity and moderator analysis
The heterogeneity is significant across these
studies with a Qvalue of 67.39, p<.01. A
Tau squared value of .258 estimates the
observed variation between effect sizes. Given
that the Qvalue is higher than the degrees of
freedom (18), this suggests that a higher pro-
portion of the variation is actual variation.

ment programs implemented during the 1990swere much more effective than those imple-mented in the 1980s and 2000s, although the1990s studies still vary significantly in theireffectiveness. The remaining moderator analy-ses show no other statistically significant dif-ferences ( Table 7 ).
Publication bias
Duval and Tweedie ’s(2000) trim and fill pro-
cedure suggests that no studies need to betrimmed from the analysis in order to create aless biased result. Additionally, a classic fail-safe N(Orwin, 1983)o f1 1 8s t u d i e sw o u l dneed to be found in order to reduce the
reported mean effect size to an insignificant
level. Finally, using the more conservativeOrwin ’sf a i l - s a f e N(Orwin, 1983), a total of
52 studies would raise the odds ratio to
over 0.90.
Analysis of general recidivism
Scope and overall effect size
Of the 25 studies, 12 report general recidivism
rates and were analyzed for treatment effect-iveness specific to general recidivism. The
overall effect size for general recidivism is
0.811, with a 95% confidence interval rangingfrom 0.645 to 1.019 ( Table 6 andFigure 2 ).
While this does not evidence an overall signifi-
cant effect of treatment, there is significant
variation in the size of the treatment effectfrom one study to the next. This variabilitymay be explained by differences in the studies,
which can be examined through moder-
ator analyses.

Heterogeneity and moderator analysis
The heterogeneity is significant across the
studies, with a Qvalue of 29.91, p<.05. The
variance in the true effect sizes is estimated ata Tau squared value of .080. Since the Qvalue
is greater than the degrees of freedom (11),this indicates that a higher proportion of thevariation is assumed to be actual variation.This is further confirmed by the I
2value of
63.22%, demonstrating there to be a moderateamount of real, observed variation.
The variables explored in relation to the
variability evident among the studies includethe treatment mandate, epidemiology, treat-ment setting, decade of implementation andCBT treatment features. There are nosignificant differences in the effect sizes of the
studies based on the CBT treatment features,

employing relapse prevention achieved a sig-

sivity (RNR) have an effect size of nearly 1.00

Publication bias
Duval and Tweedie ’s(2000) trim and fill pro-
cedure revealed an adjusted point estimate of
0.811, suggesting that no studies needed tobe trimmed from the analysis. As a result, a
classic fail-safe N(Orwin, 1983)o f1 4s t u d i e s
would need to be found in order to reduce thereported mean effect size to an insignificantlevel. In addition, if setting the criterion for a
trivial odds ratio to 0.90, Orwin ’sf a i l - s a f e N
(Orwin, 1983) suggests that a total of five
studies would raise the odds ratio over 0.90.
Analysis of violent/combination recidivism
Scope and overall effect size
Of the 25 studies, a total of 11 report violent/
combination recidivism rates and were ana-lyzed for treatment effectiveness specific to
violent/combination recidivism. The overall
effect size for violent/combination recidivism is0.642, with a 95% confidence interval ranging
from 0.446 to 0.925 ( Table 6 andFigure 3 ). As
this evidences an overall significant effect fortreatment, assessment of both heterogeneity
and moderator analyses were undertaken.Heterogeneity and moderator analysis
The highest degree of heterogeneity is evi-
denced in this analysis. The heterogeneity isstatistically significant across these studies,with a Qvalue of 46.67, p<.01. In addition,
since the Qvalue is higher than the degrees of
freedom (10), this suggests that a higher pro-portion of the variation is real variation.Finally, a Tau squared of .233 and an I
2value
of 78.57% further confirm the high amount of
real, observed variation that is present.
Six moderator analyses were undertaken in
an attempt to explain the variation in the effectsizes. The variables explored for the variabilityevident among the studies include the follow-up period, epidemiology, therapy form (group,individual or both), treatment mandate, treat-ment setting and decade of implementation.Significant differences were found in the effect
size of the studies based on the decade of
implementation, Q

grams implemented in the 1990s were muchmore effective than those implemented in the1980s. The remaining moderator analyses
show no statistically significant differences
(Table 7 ).
Publication bias
Duval and Tweedie ’s(2000) trim and fill ana-
lysis revealed two studies that needed to betrimmed and filled to the right of the mean,resulting in an adjusted point estimate of 0.778from an observed estimate of 0.642. In orderto reduce the reported effect size to insignifi-
cance, a classic fail-safe N(Orwin, 1983)o f
30 studies would be necessary. However,Orwin ’sf a i l - s a f e N(Orwin, 1983) suggests
that a total of four studies would be necessaryto raise the odds ratio to over 0.90.
Discussion
This meta-analysis has found support for the
proposition that sexual offender CBTtreatment programs are an effective method of
reducing recidivism. Overall, the results of the
analyses demonstrate that CBT programs are
effective in reducing sexual and violent/com-
bination recidivism behaviors post-treatment.When further analyzing the variability among
the studies, the findings show the effect of the
treatment employed during the 1990s as sig-nificant, suggesting that the programs deliv-
ered during this time period were slightly
more effective than those delivered during the1980s and 2000s.
Interestingly, these results are supported
by several previous meta-analyses which
found that treated sexual offenders exhibit
lower levels of sexual recidivism (Gallagher
et al., 1999;H a n s o n , 2009;H a n s o ne ta l . ,
2002;L€osel & Schmucker, 2005; Polizzi et al.,
1999). The findings of the current meta-
analysis concerning sexual recidivism bode
well for these treatment programs ’goals; spe-
cifically, many programs are structured to
focus on the prevention of the sexual reof-
fenses that are particular to the individuals ’
previous sexual offenses, and this is the pur-
pose of their referral to treatment.
Figure 3. Odds ratio forest plot for violent/combination recidivism rates of treatment versus control.Sexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 17
On the other hand, the present meta-ana-
lysis found no difference based on treatment
for general recidivism rates (i.e., the treatedand untreated offenders have similar general
recidivism rates). These results are also sup-
ported by the early findings of the sexualoffender treatment effectiveness research con-
ducted by Hanson and Bussi /C18ere ( 1998)a n d
Hanson and Morton-Bourgon ( 2005), who
found that sexual offenders are more likely to
reoffend by committing non-sexual rather thansexual offenses. These findings concerning
general recidivism are not surprising, given
that general reoffense is not a focus withinmost treatment programs.
As part of the moderator analyses of gen-
eral recidivism, relapse prevention was notfound to be a significant feature of CBT
treatment. However, some of the variability
could explain why the treatment programs
utilizing relapse prevention (either as a
framework or a module of treatment) werefound to be more effective than those utiliz-
ing a combination of relapse prevention and
RNR. While not significantly different, itmakes sense that there is a difference
between these two types of programs, since
relapse prevention focuses on identifying
potential high-risk behaviors upon release
a n dc r e a t i n ga ni n d i v i d u a l i z e dp l a nt op r e v e n tinstances of relapse, whereas the added RNR
framework also incorporates a focus on
offenders ’risk levels, criminogenic needs
and responsivity factors. These RNR factors
are also tailored specifically to the individual
offender; thus, offenders who are considered
at high risk for reoffense participate in a
more intensive management program thanthose considered low risk. It is possible that
there may be differing benefits to treatment
(e.g., individual offender level, treatmentlevel) that employs a relapse prevention mod-
ule or framework compared to one that com-
bines relapse prevention with an RNRframework. Further research exploring these
potential benefits is certainly warranted,
given that many of the current CBTtreatment programs that are offered utilize
both sets of frameworks.
Unique to the 1990s was a significant
increase in the development of treatment pro-
grams worldwide, as well as an increase in
interest in conducting and publishing moreresearch in the field. Interestingly this is evi-
denced in the present meta-analysis, as many
of the studies that administered treatment
during this decade included evaluated treat-
ment programs. The treatment techniquesemployed throughout this period were also
advancing with regard to the reformulation
of relapse prevention, which ultimatelyenabled programs to recognize that offenders
have disparate issues and treatment needs
(Hudson, Ward, & McCormack, 1999). This
decade was also critical to the treatment his-
tory of sexual offenders, as interest began to
rise in creating treatment programs that meet
offenders ’n e e d sa sw e l la si n c r e a s i n gt r e a t -
ment effectiveness. Also, within the 1990sfederal funding was remarkably abundant, as
each US jurisdiction was successful in enact-
ing registration and community notificationlaws (Logan, 2010). As a result, it is import-
ant to consider these factors as possible rea-
sons for the higher level of treatment
effectiveness in the 1990s. At the turn of the
century, there was a rising interest in qualita-tive approaches to treatment research.
Furthermore, the 2000s began with an
increased focus on the implementation ofstrength-based models of treatment wherein
varying degrees of research on effectiveness
currently exist. Schwartz ( 2008)c o m m e n t s
that the administration at the time eliminated
funding for the Center for Sex OffenderManagement, which is the division of the
Department of Justice (DoJ) dedicated to
training jurisdictions on how to effectivelymanage the sexual offender population. In
addition, with the federal implementation of
the Adam Walsh Act in 2006, the adminis-tration held that if any jurisdiction failed to
implement the act, funding for that jurisdic-
tion would be surrendered (Logan, 2010).18 J. L. Harrison et al.
It is suggested that the present results are
generalizable to adult male sexual offenders
ranging in age from 18 to 75 years and basedin English-speaking countries who are receiv-
ing treatment in either institutional or commu-
nity-based settings. In addition, these resultscan be generalized to most sexual offender
populations receiving treatment, as most of the
studies included in this meta-analysis excluded
offenders who evidenced significant intellec-
tual disability or severe psychopathology.Overall, these effect sizes are also generaliz-
able to CBT programs currently implemented
in English-speaking countries under both man-dated and voluntary conditions. It is important
to note, however, that a few studies define
some variables differently. For example, one
study includes lapse in behavior as a definition
for general recidivism, which may contributeto a less conservative (possible overestimation)
measure of recidivism behaviors.
These results should still be interpreted
cautiously however, as approximately 40% of
the included studies employ the use of the
intention-to-treat method for epidemiology.Consequently, these studies include dropouts
(if any are noted) within the treatment group,
which could contribute to a possible under-
estimation of the treatment effect. This treat-
ment effect is likely an underestimation anddifficult to interpret, given that the dropouts
did not fully complete the program and were
thus less likely to benefit from treatment. Onthe other hand, approximately 60% of the
included studies employed the use of the per-
protocol analysis method for epidemiology,
wherein dropouts are excluded from treat-
ment groups in the analysis, which can con-tribute to a possible overestimation of the
treatment effect. Thus, the actual treatment
effect is likely balanced out due to the use ofboth of these epidemiological methods.
While the studies included in this meta-ana-
lysis vary considerably with high heterogen-eity across general, sexual and violent/
combination analyses, the research designs
are generally considered strong. As requiredfor inclusion, the studies must employ both a
treatment and control or comparison group
for analysis. Additionally, a random-effects
model was utilized for all analyses, as thismodel is most appropriate due to the inherent
variability across the treatment programs.
This model accurately portrays the treatmenteffects by attributing a more appropriate
weight to larger and smaller studies than
would be the case had a fixed-effects model
been chosen.
Limitations
Several limitations of this meta-analysis
should be noted. In order to maintain an
acceptable level of rigor, only studies that
employed both a treatment and a control or
comparison group were considered for inclu-sion. Without a control or comparison group,
treatment findings are ultimately rendered less
meaningful. In addition, only adult male sex-
ual offenders are included, limiting overall
generalizability specific to the sexual offenderpopulation. However, past research demon-
strates that it is necessary to investigate female
sexual offenders separately, as they evidence
disparate treatment needs that do not general-
ize well if these analyses are combined (Faller1987,1995) .T h es a m ei s s u e sa r i s ef o ra d o l e s -
cent and developmentally delayed sexual
offender populations. Any definition of recid-
ivism that is not specified was included as
missing data, and multiple categories of recid-ivism definitions were employed within the
coding manual in order to capture the most
accurate definitions utilized. In terms of epi-demiology, either intention-to-treat or per-
protocol analysis was utilized. Finally, any
studies that were considered to have overlap-
ping participant samples were further exam-
ined; studies with the highest participantnumber of those that overlapped were
included, and those with lower percentages
were excluded.
Of the 25 studies included, a few contain
unclear information or missing data that may
have impacted the results. Certain codes hadSexual Offender Treatment Effectiveness 19
to be estimated based on a range provided or
denoted as missing data when the information
was not stated, which may have impacted the
overall treatment effect. For example, twostudies do not specify the type of recidivism
measured and were included as unknown
(missing data) within the violent/combinationrecidivism category. An example of unclear
information is that of a study not explicitly
stating the decade of implementation; thus, it
is necessary to make an educated guess based
on the study ’s publication year, the duration of
the treatment and the length of the data collec-
tion. Inferring codes was only employed when
multiple sources of information within the
study supported an educated guess; however,
there still exists the possibility for humanerror. The blind coding and interrater reliabil-
ity process helped control for and mitigate
this limitation.
Publication bias findings also revealed par-
ticularly low fail-safe Nvalues for both sexual
and violent/comparison recidivism rates, sug-
gesting that a few studies with poor effectsizes could potentially overturn the results
found. Given that the present meta-analysis
included 25 studies, the likelihood of finding a
few additional studies is possible. As a result,
studies of this nature with potentially loweffect sizes could lower the effect size to trivial
proportions, thus lessening the treatment
effect. Finally, due to studies ’different con-
ceptualizations of violent recidivism rates, as
well as the fact that some studies combine vio-lent recidivism with other forms, it was neces-
sary to combine these rates for the final
analysis. As a result, the conclusions from theviolent/combination category are somewhat
limited, as it is difficult to separate violent
recidivism treatment effects from com-
bined effects.
Treatment implications
There are several implications for treatment
programs based on the results of this meta-
analysis, which suggest that the CBT treatment
administered during the 1990s was moreeffective for offenders who engaged in sexual
and violent/combination recidivism behaviors.Due to the small sample of studies included,
the results certainly warrant further investiga-
tion into aspects of the treatments that were
administered throughout the 1990s. Of consid-
erable interest are reformulations of relapseprevention, as most of the programs examined
in this meta-analysis incorporated relapse pre-
vention or a combination of relapse preventionand RNR principles as features of treatment. It
could be that much greater emphasis was
placed on relapse prevention during thisperiod, as well as on efforts to improve this
feature of CBT treatment. As there was a surge
of research interest and program developmentworldwide during the 1990s, it is important to
analyze studies from this period in isolation, in
order to determine if their programs can standalone with significant treatment effects. If so,
this could provide valuable information and
insight into aspects of the treatments adminis-tered that were unique to this period in the his-
tory of sexual offender treatment.
Future research
In order to expand upon the existing literature
on sexual offender treatment effectiveness, itis imperative to explore multiple measures of
recidivism that are investigated within the
available studies. While sexual recidivism ismost often investigated, as these offenses dir-
e c t l ya l i g nw i t ht h ef o c u so fm o s tt r e a t m e n t
programs, it would be especially interesting toexplore treatment effectiveness associated
with general recidivism. Currently, the major-
ity of research findings support a reduction insexual offense recidivism post-treatment.
Similarly, there is support demonstrating a
greater reduction in sexual offenses rather than
non-sexual offenses (Hanson & Bussi /C18ere,
1998; Hanson & Morton-Bourgon, 2005). As
the treatment effectiveness results currently
indicate general recidivism to be more prob-
lematic post-treatment than sexual recidivism,further research isolating general recidivism
which provides greater detail regarding the20 J. L. Harrison et al.
types of offense that are most likely to be com-
mitted post-treatment would be helpful for
determining the factors that might be associ-ated with this particular type of recidivism.
As relapse prevention seems to be widely
used either as a module or framework of CBT
treatment programs, it would be helpful toexplore this aspect further. Determining sig-
nificant differences between using relapse pre-
vention as a simple module of treatmentversus an entire framework for a sexualoffender treatment program could offer valu-
able information to assist treatment providers
in better tailoring programs to individualoffenders ’specific needs. Also unique to treat-
ment, offenders ’within-treatment changes on
variables such as empathy and sexual deviancy
are important areas for future research. Theavailable literature has been slow to produce
rigorous findings that employ both treatment
and control or comparison groups to assessthese within-treatment changes. Exploration ofproximal variables associated with core treat-
ment targets (e.g., problem-solving ability,
offense-supportive attitudes and sexual devi-ancy) could help to determine what works dur-
ing treatment. Such information could further
treatment providers ’ability to appropriately
tailor programs to meet individual offenders ’
needs, as well as to optimize treatment effect-
iveness. Future researchers are encouraged to
employ the use of control or comparisongroups, as similar current available literature
is scarce.
When conducting future meta-analyses,
there are a number of variables that are essen-tial to include for an acceptable amount of
rigor. Especially when measuring treatment
effectiveness, it becomes important to have theability to formulate meaningful interpretations
across studies within this bed of literature.
Some essential variables include: (a) the use ofa control or comparison group, (b) multipledefinitions of types of recidivism (e.g., sexual,
general, violent), (c) specified definitions of
recidivism (e.g., recharge, rearrest, reconvic-tion), (d) specified population (e.g., males,females, adolescents, developmentally
delayed), (e) distal measures of treatment
effectiveness (e.g., recidivism), (f) proximalmeasures of treatment effectiveness (e.g., coretreatment targets such as empathy, sexual devi-
ancy and offense responsibility) and (g) no
overlapping participant samples.
Overall, the results of this meta-analysis
suggest that CBT-based treatment programs
implemented in English-speaking countries for
adult male sexual offenders are effective inreducing sexual and violent/combination recid-
ivism rates. As this analysis found no differ-
ence in treatment for general recidivism,further research isolating this type of recidiv-ism is warranted. Also unique to this analysis
is the finding that the treatments employed
during the 1990s were more effective thanthose employed during the 1980s and 2000s.
While this meta-analysis provides further sup-
port for the current sexual offender treatmenteffectiveness literature, more research isneeded in order to effectively tailor programs
to individual offenders ’needs. Ultimately,
determining within-treatment changes(empathy, problem-solving, etc.) can assistclinicians in making the necessary adjustments
to continually reduce recidivism rates. Future
researchers are strongly encouraged to explorewithin-treatment changes as a means of broad-
ening this field ’s current traditional method of
defining treatment effectiveness solelyusing recidivism.

ArticlesEffectiveness of psychological interventions in prison to 
reduce recidivism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
Gabrielle Beaudry, Rongqin Yu, Amanda E Perry, Seena Fazel
Summary
Background Repeat offending, also known as criminal recidivism, in people released from prison has remained high 
over many decades. To address this, psychological treatments have been increasingly used in criminal justice settings; however, there is little evidence about their effectiveness. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in prison to reduce recidivism after release.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for articles published from database 
inception to F eb 17, 2021, without any language restrictions. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that 
evaluated the effect of psychological interventions, delivered to adolescents and adults during incarceration, on recidivism outcomes after release. We excluded studies of solely pharmacological interventions and of participants in secure psychiatric hospitals or special residential units, or attending therapies mainly delivered outside of the prison 
setting. We extracted summary estimates from eligible RCTs. Data were extracted and appraised according to a 
prespecified protocol, with effect sizes converted to odds ratios.  We used a standardised form to extract the effects of 
interventions on recidivism and estimated risk of bias for each RCT. Planned sensitivity analyses were done by 
removing studies with fewer than 50 participants.  Our primary outcome was recidivism. Data from individual RCTs 
were combined in a random-effects meta-analysis as pooled odds ratios (ORs) and we explored sources of heterogeneity by comparing effect sizes by study size, control group, and intervention type. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020167228.
Findings Of 6345 articles retrieved, 29 RCTs (9443 participants, 1104 [11· 7%] females, 8111 [85· 9%] males, and 228 [2· 4%] 
unknown) met the inclusion criteria for the primary outcome. Mean ages were 3 1·4 years (SD 4· 9, range 24· 5–41·5) for 
adult participants and 17·5 years (SD 1· 9; range 14· 6–20·2) for adolescent participants.  Race or ethnicity data were not 
sufficiently reported to be aggregated. If including all 29 RCTs, psychological interventions were associated with reduced 
reoffending outcomes (OR 0· 72, 95% CI 0· 56–0·92). However, after excluding smaller studies (<50 participants in the 
intervention group), there was no significant reduction in recidivism (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0 ·68–1·11). Based on two studies, 
therapeutic communities were associated with decreased rates of recidivism (O R 0·64, 95% CI 0·46–0·91). These risk 
estimates did not significantly differ by type of control group and other study characteristics. 
Interpretation Widely implemented psychological interventions for people in prison to reduce offending after release 
need improvement. Publication 
bias and small-study effects appear to have overestimated the reported modest effects 
of such interventions, which were no longer present when only larger studies were included in analyses.  Findings 
suggest that therapeutic communities and interventions that ensure continuity of care in community settings should 
be prioritised for future research. Developing new treatments should focus on addressing modifiable risk factors for reoffending.

Introduction
11 million people are currently held in jails or prisons 
worldwide and every year 30 million individuals enter and leave custody.
1,2 People released from jails or prisons 
have a higher risk of repeat offending than people given community-based sanctions, and account for nearly a fifth of all new crimes annually.
3 Typically, between a 
third and a half of people released from prison reoffend within 2 years.
4 The societal costs of recidivism are considerable, and include public health and associated economic effects. For example, the annual social and economic cost of reoffending is estimated at more than £18·1 billion in the UK and US$13 billion in one US large state (Illinois) alone.
5,6
Various psychological interventions have been used in 
custodial settings to improve outcomes for people released from prison, and to reduce reoffending in particular. Some reviews suggested that cognitive Lancet Psychiatry 2021;

Articles760  www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   September 2021behavioural therapy (CBT) programmes are among the 
most effective interventions, with meta-analyses reporting 
recidivism risk reductions of 20–30%.7–13 Furthermore, 
treatment programme adherence to risk–need–
responsivity prin  ciples14 is associated with reductions in 
reoffending; however, this link is based on predominantly quasi-experimental studies.
15–17 Overall, the effectiveness 
of most prison-based treatments on recidivism remains unclear because the evidence is inconsistent and subject to a range of limitations.
18–28 Previous reviews have often 
focused on specific groups—eg, women,26,29 adole -
scents,20,23 individuals who use drugs,25 people living with 
a mental health condition,18 and people with sexual21,28 or 
other violent19,27 index offences. There are considerable 
methodological differences between these reviews, particularly in the quality of included primary studies,
20 
and the sources of this heterogeneity have rarely been examined.
18 Also, existing reviews have pooled estimates 
that combine samples from diverse settings (eg, prisons and secure psychiatric hospitals)
24 or were published 
before 2008.19,22,23,29 To address these limitations, we aimed 
to synthesise reoffending outcomes from all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions provided in prisons.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for RCTs published from database 
inception until Feb 17, 2021. The search strategy combined terms relating to RCTs (ie, random*, trial*, placebo*), psychological interventions (eg, program*, intervention*, treatment*), incarceration (eg, prison*, incarcerat*, custod*), and recidivism (eg, recommit*, reoffend*, recidiv*). For the full list of search terms see appendix pp 3–7 . We also manually searched the reference lists of included studies, and relevant articles and systematic reviews. 
We included RCTs of psychological interventions in jails 
and prisons that reported on criminal recidivism occurring after release from prison  as an outcome. Studies were 
eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: RCT (including pilot studies and cluster-randomised trials); all participants were incarcerated at the time of random allocation (including adolescents, people in custody awaiting trial, and people residing in immigration detention centres) and remained incarcerated for 
the duration of the treatment; participants assigned to control groups were exposed to the usual intervention, no intervention, or an alternative intervention to the 
experimental group; intervention was psycho  logical 
(eg, CBT or mindfulness-based therapy) or psycho -
educational (eg, vocational or educational training); interventions (both individual and group formats) were delivered in a jail or prison setting; and the recidivism 
outcome (eg, recon  viction, reincarceration, rearrest, parole Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO from database inception to Feb 17, 2021, for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered in prisons, without language restrictions. We used similar keywords across databases relating to psychological interventions (eg, program*, intervention*, treatment*), incarceration (eg, prison*, incarcerat*, custod*), and recidivism (eg, recommit*, reoffend*, recidiv*). We identified several relevant systematic reviews, but none provided a comprehensive overview of the evidence base, as their scope was limited to specific groups of individuals (eg, people with co-occurring mental illness or people in specific offence categories), or certain types of intervention (eg, CBT). Furthermore, previous reviews have included studies using non-experimental designs, which are liable to overestimate effects. Despite this limitation, these reviews stated that some psychological interventions (eg, CBT and risk–need–responsivity therapies) are effective in reducing recidivism on release from prison.
Added value of this study
We did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered in prisons on recidivism outcomes after release. We provide an 
up to date systematic review, which is both broader in scope (by including all prisoners irrespective of criminal history, setting, or psychological treatment) and more precise (by including only randomised controlled trials) than previous reviews. The effects were considerably smaller than expert opinion had previously maintained, with no clear effects of CBT-based treatments.
Implications of all the available evidence
Psychological treatments, which were developed to treat mental health conditions, need to be adapted to target modifiable risk factors that are specific to reoffending.  
Continued treatment after prison release should be integrated into therapeutic programmes. The evidence is inconclusive for most psychological interventions, and the findings of this systematic review could inform how different treatment modalities should be prioritised in service development and future trials.

intervention and control groups. We included studies in which post-prison services were offered to participants on a voluntary basis, but were not directly part of the evaluated intervention (eg, the Challenge to Change,
30 and the Amity 
therapeutic community programmes31). We excluded 
studies on the basis of the following criteria: trial not randomised (eg, case studies and pretest–post-test comparisons); participants were not in jail or prison at the time of the study (eg, they were on parole, in a secure psychiatric hospital, attending therapies outside of the prison setting, or residing in community-based special residential units formerly known as bootcamps); the control group included primarily people who dropped out or refused treatment altogether; the intervention was based solely on a pharmacological approach; and the study compared jail or prison with a community sanction (eg, prison vs bootcamp) or involved a joint prison and 
community programme for which the community component accounted for more than half of the intervention duration (eg, the CREST programme
32,33).  
There was no limit on the follow-up time period for reoffending. Non-English language studies were translated and considered for inclusion.
One author (GB) did the searches and screened the titles 
and abstracts of the studies identified using the search strategy and screened the full text of those matching the predetermined inclusion criteria. In cases of uncertainty, GB consulted with RY and consensus was reached about study selection. SF resolved any disagreements about inclusion and verified the eligibility of included studies. GB extracted summary estimates from eligible RCTs.
This systematic review was done in accordance with 
the Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines
34 (appendix pp 1–2).
Data analysis
We extracted from eligible studies information for: year of publication; geographical location; correctional setting; sample size; sex; ethnicity (Asian, Black or African American, White, Hispanic or Latinx, Indigenous, and Other); average age of participants ; follow-up period for 
recidivism; intervention length, type, and format; definition of recidivism; and numbers of individuals in the intervention and control groups by recidivism status (ie, having reoffended vs not having reoffended). If there 
were multiple assessments of recidivism in a study, we used the most serious outcome for the meta-analysis (eg, reconviction was preferred to rearrest). For samples that featured both males and females but for which the recidivism outcome was not reported separately by sex, those including at least 90% males were recorded as 
males, whereas those with fewer than 90% males were recorded as both. If multiple articles were available for a given study (eg, the Amity therapeutic community programme
35,36), we included the article with the longest 
follow-up period for recidivism.32 We contacted relevant study authors if additional data or clarifications were required.
The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Each RCT was given an overall estimation of risk 
of bias (ie, low risk, some concerns, or high risk) according to the following domains for risk of bias: randomisation process; deviations from intended interventions; missing outcome data; measurement of the outcome; and selection of the reported result.
37 Trials 
with a high risk of bias in at least one domain were rated as having a high risk of bias. 
The primary outcome was recidivism. This measure 
was assessed with the summary odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI. We sought both continuous and dichotomous data on recidivism. To enable comparison 
across studies, when the outcome was given as contin -
uous data, we first attempted to obtain the equivalent dichotomous data from the authors of the primary studies. If we were unable to do so, we converted the standardised mean difference to ORs (using the formula recommended by the Cochrane Handbook
38). One study 
was excluded because of insufficient information.39 
Furthermore, for multiarm trials,40,41 two distinct 
approaches recommended by the Cochrane Handbook38 
were used to avoid double-counting participants in the shared control group. For one study,
40 we merged both 
intervention arms into a single com  parison group, as 
they both were psychoeducational interventions. For another study,
41 we included each pairwise comparison 
separately (one was psychoedu  cational and the other 
CBT-based) by evenly dividing the shared control group among the comparisons.
We did a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the 
effect sizes, because this gives similar weights to studies with different sample sizes and substantial heterogeneity 
was expected between studies (eg, for type and length of interventions and follow-up periods). Pooled OR estimates were grouped into domains and summarised using forest plots. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using Cochran’s Q (reported with a χ²-value 
and p value) and the I² statistic. Amounts of heterogeneity 
were evaluated according to thresholds: low (0–40%), 
moderate (30–60%), substantial (50–90%), and con -
siderable (75–100%).38 These heterogeneity measures 
should be interpreted with caution if the number of studies is small (eg, in subgroup analyses).
42
We first pooled all individual RCTs to calculate the 
summary effect size. We then stratified studies according to whether the psychological intervention group was larger than 50 participants.
31,32,43–56 This cutoff was 
determined in accordance with previous research on randomised experiments (eg, psychotherapy for adult depression
57) to maximise the key beneficial effect of 
randomisation (ie, controlling for unknown and unmeasurable variables
58,59), and rule out potential small- 
study effects.60 Among these studies, we explored the For more on the Cochrane

other) and intervention type (ie, CBT-based, psycho -
educational, therapeutic communities, and other), and 
excluded two studies43,56 from the secondary analysis on 
the basis of considerable differences in treatment duration (eg, one session only)
56 and delivery mode (eg, 
video feedback of previous sessions43). All interventions 
based on cognitive behavioural approaches were con -
sidered to be CBT-based psychological inter  ventions.44–47,49,55 
Interventions with a core vocational or educational component (eg, deterrence
51) were included in the 
psychoeducational category.50 Interventions of thera -
peutic communities formed another category.30,31 Both 
therapeutic community trials included voluntary post-prison services. Most (83%) participants from the Challenge to Change trial
30 chose to access community-
based mental health or substance abuse services, although these were beyond the scope of that  study. 
The Amity therapeutic community offered residential treat ment to programme graduates (experimental group 
only) at an Amity-operated facility called Vista.31 The effect 
of Vista on recidivism was not considered in our meta-analysis, to avoid annulling the effects of randomisation; however, we reported percentages in the Discussion. The other intervention category combined reality therapy,
48 
social therapy,5 interactive journaling,54 and gender-
responsive substance abuse therapy.52
Prespecified subgroup (mixed-effects) and meta-
regression analyses were done to examine sources of heterogeneity. The following study characteristics were assessed: year of publication (<1990 vs ≥1990; to account 
for the formalisation of the risk-need-responsivity model in 1990),
14 study location (USA vs elsewhere), sample size 
(as a continuous variable), sex (sex-specific interventions vs those delivered to both males and females simul-
taneously), mean participant age (as a continuous variable), age group (adolescents vs adults), intervention 
type (CBT-based vs all other types), comparator type (usual care vs waitlist or other), follow-up time period (as a 
continuous variable), intervention format (individual vs 
group or combination), intervention aimed at substance use disorder (as a dichotomous variable) and risk of bias (high vs low or some concerns).
We did influence analysis on all studies to determine 
which of them disproportionately influenced the summary effect of our meta-analysis. We used the leave-one-out method and showed results using the Baujat plot.
61
We examined publication bias in all studies using the 
Egger’s test of the intercept62 and funnel plot analysis. If 
the Egger’s test reported publication bias and between-study heterogeneity was not substantial,
63 we followed 
the trim and fill procedure64 to correct for publication 
bias by imputing missing studies into a new symmetrical funnel plot.
65
If the results of the publication bias analysis indicated 
small-study effects, we did further sensitivity analyses.  First, we compared the fixed-effect and random-effect estimates of the intervention effect, because a more favourable estimate in the random-effects model might indicate that interventions were more effective in smaller 
studies. We did an additional analysis by only inclu -
ding studies with an intervention group of at least  
100 participants.30,31,44,46,47,49,50,53,55 We did this to reduce small-
study effects, and to evaluate the robustness of the findings, as small trials are susceptible to selection bias and tend to have larger treatment effects than large trials.
65,66 We also 
investigated the effect of study quality on the pooled effect size, by removing studies at high risk of bias.
All statistical analyses were done in R version 3.6.2 and 
R Studio version 1.4.1717 .
67,68 The study protocol was 
registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020167228.

We identified 6345 articles through electronic searches 
and 29 eligible trials (for selection process see figure 1 and 
for study characteristics see table 1).30,31,40,41,43–56,69–75,77–80 Most 
RCTs were two-arm trials (n=27); two were three-arm trials.
40,41 These trials described 31 psychological inter -
ventions that were combined into 30 pairwise treatment comparisons, on which the statistical analyses were based. In total, 9443 individuals (1104 [11· 7%] females, 
8111 [85·9%] males, and 228 [2·4%] individuals for whom sex was not reported) participated in the trials, and 6528 (1118 [17·1%] adolescents and 5410 [82·9%] adults) had recidivism outcome data.  The mean age was 31·4 years 
(SD 4·9, range 24·5–41·5) in adults and 17·5 years 
(1·9, 14·6–20·2) in adolescents. Descriptive statistics on the age of participants were calculated using the mean age from each study and the range of mean ages (if available). Race or ethnicity data from each study are summarised in the appendix (pp 8–9). Among included trials, 19 were from the USA (n=3578 [54 ·8%]),
30,31,41,44,46–52,54,69,71,72,74,75,78,79 
four from Canada (n=2351),40,43,55,70 two from the UK 
(n=203);45,56 and one each from Germany (n=223),53 
Sweden (n=59),73 Japan (n=50),77 and Norway (n=64).80 
Treatment duration varied considerably between trials, ranging from one session only
56 to multiple interventions 
that lasted for 1 year.31,74 The most frequent source of trial 
funding was government-funded research council. None of the psychological interventions was described as being mandatory and recruitment of participants was voluntary. However, it is possible that perceived coercion and other incentives could have contributed to the decision to participate.
In terms of risk of bias, most RCTs were rated as having 
concerns (n=18, 60%) or being at high risk (n=10, 33%), and only two studies
46,54 were rated as having a low risk of 
bias (appendix pp 10–12).  There was a low risk of bias in 
outcome measurement for all studies, because recidivism was ascertained from official criminal records.
Overall in the meta-analysis, psychological interventions 
were associated with reduced reoffending, with a pooled OR of 0·72 (95% CI 0·56–0·92) and moderate levels of heterogeneity (I ²=49%; Q =57·3; p<0·01; figure 2). To 
prevent overestimation caused by small-study effect, as suggested by the literature
65,66 and confirmed by our 
influence analysis, we pooled results excluding studies with fewer than 50 participants in the experimental group, as a planned sensitivity analysis. The reduction in 
recidivism was attenuated in the 14 trials (6446 followed-up participants) with an intervention group of at least 50 participants (OR 0· 87, 95% CI 0· 68–1· 11; I²=54%; 
figure 3).
Subgroup analyses are shown by comparator type in 
figure 4, and by intervention type in figure 5. RCTs 
with a control group of usual care were associated with recidivism but not significantly so (OR 0·97,

Articleswww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   September 2021  7670%), the reduction in recidivism was larger although CIs 
were overlapping. By treatment modality, CBT-based interventions were not associated with recidivism (1·00, 
0·69–1·44; 60%) neither were psychoeducational inter -
ventions (1·11, 0·38–3·20; 79%). Other types of inter -
ventions were associated with non-significant reductions in recidivism (0·74, 0·47–1·18; 44%). However, there were reductions in reoffending risk for therapeutic community programmes (0·64, 0·46–0·91; 0%).
On univariate analyses, there was a statistically 
significant difference between the pooled effects of trials which included sex-specific samples compared with trails that included both males and females (Q 4·30; 
p=0·04). Sex-specific interventions were significantly associated with reduced recidivism (OR  0·67, 95% CI 
0·50–0·90), whereas those including both males and females were not (1·09, 0·77–1·55). No other significant associations were found between prespecified study characteristics and effect sizes in subgroup or meta-regression analyses (table 2). 
Two studies
49,74 that contributed disproportionately to 
the pooled effect were identified using influence analyses in all RCTs. Removal of these outliers reduced the degree of heterogeneity between studies from moderate ( I²=49%) 
to low (38%) but did not materially alter the pooled effect size (OR 0· 73, 95% CI 0· 58–0· 91; appendix pp 13–15).
We found evidence of publication bias using Egger’s 
test (
t = −2·12; p=0·04) suggesting small-study effects. 
This finding was supported by visual inspection of the related funnel plot, which showed asymmetry (appendix pp 16–17). Seven smaller studies were identified and trimmed using the trim and fill method,
40,69,72–75,78 and the 
OR after adjusting for publication bias was 0 ·86 (95% CI 
0·65–1·15).
The fixed-effect estimate (OR 0·81, 95% CI 0·72–0·91; 
I²=49%; appendix p 18) did not materially differ from the Figure 2: Effectiveness of psychological interventions in prison in reducing recidivism

Discussion
In this meta-analysis of psychological interventions for recidivism, we identified 29 jail-based or prison-based RCTs of 9443 individuals from seven countries. Overall, there was evidence of reduced odds of reoffending.  To 
account for small-study effects, in a planned sensitivity analysis, we excluded studies with fewer than 50 people in each experimental arm, resulting in 14 trials with 6446 followed-up participants, and the overall pooled OR 0·87 (95% CI 0·68–1·11) indicated, at most, modest effects.
We report two other main findings. First, in a sensitivity 
analysis, we found no strong evidence of reduced reoffending after participation in CBT-based programmes in prison (OR 1·00, 95% CI 0·69–1·44; I²=60%). This is by 
contrast with a 2007 systematic review combining both prison-based and community-based interventions that reported reduced risks of 20–30%.
13 One potential 
explanation for no clear effectiveness of such CBT interventions found in the current systematic review is that these interventions are not linked with psychosocial support upon release. It might also be that these 
psychological therapies, which were developed for mental health problems, do not address the accommodation, employment, and financial difficulties after release that contribute to recidivism risk.
81A second finding, from a subgroup analysis, was that 
participation in a therapeutic community was associated with reduced reoffending risk. However, this finding was limited to only two studies,
30,31 both of which linked people 
released from prison to voluntary post-prison services. In support of this finding, in one of the two trials, links to community services were associated with a lower return to custody rate (33 [42%] of 79) than for participants without such links (137 [86%] of 159).
31 Findings from a 
systematic review82 of psychoeducational programmes for 
reducing prison violence are consistent with the potential role of therapeutic communities, as programmes tailored to specific needs (eg, substance use disorder) were associated with reduced institutional violence. Similar results were reported in a Cochrane review
83 of any people 
who offended and had co-occurring drug and mental health problems, as three
35,74,76 of the four included 
studies35,56,74,76 found therapeutic communities were 
associated with reductions in recidivism.
There are several implications for treatments offered in 
prison. First, in-prison interventions might not be effective unless they are linked with interventions that target the psychosocial needs of released individuals. For example, two therapeutic community trials
30,31 highlighted 
the potential importance of community aftercare to maintain the therapeutic gains delivered in prison. Hence, psychological interventions that combine prison-based and community-based services should be prioritised for future research. It should be noted that UK efforts to implement the Through the Gate service for resettling people released from prison have been widely criticised for inadequate communication between Lewis (1983)51

Figure 3: Effectiveness of psychological interventions in prison in reducing recidivism
Data are for the 14 randomised controlled trials with an intervention group of at least 50 participants, excluding two outlier studies.43,56 Error bars show 95% CI. 
The number of participants in the intervention and control groups were not available for Dugan and Everett48 or Burraston and Eddy46 because these studies 
presented outcomes as continuous rather than dichotomous data.

assessment of resettlement needs, which should occur early in the sentence of a person in prison.
84 
Second, most of the tested interventions were developed 
in the community or in clinical populations for other outcomes, and hence might not address risk factors specific to reoffending. Such risk factors need to be identified by high quality assessment, and then linked to interventions for reducing recidivism.  Risk assessments 
should be informed by scalable and transparent clinical prediction tools, such as the Oxford Risk of Recidivism tool (also known as OxRec),
85 which includes assessment of 
modifiable risk factors for recidivism (eg, substance misuse and mental health status), supplemented by detailed assessments that consider additional dynamic factors. Considering that the resources allocated for interventions in prison populations are limited,
86 
stratification of risk is necessary to guide risk management and the treatment of people on release from prison.
A third implication regards CBT. The absence of effect 
that we reported is different to evidence from some reviews (including one published by the Campbell Collaboration
13), which have suggested that CBT is one of 
the most effective forms of treatment for people in prison.
7–12 However, these previous reviews combined 
RCTs with less than rigorous study designs and the current new findings question the widespread roll-out of these treatment approaches in prisons. Only one
45 of the 
six CBT studies44–47,49,55 in our systematic review reported 
significant reductions in reoffending. Other research, in selected populations of all people who have offended and also use drugs, also found little support for CBT.
83,87
Another implication of our review is that the effects 
of in-prison psychological interventions on recidivism appear to be smaller than those reported in previous meta-analyses, which have been estimated to be around 0·65 (95% CI 0·57–0·75).
24 This difference is 
probably because the previous reviews included studies using weak research designs, such as quasi-experimental studies.
88 A similar difference has been 
noted for psychotherapy effectiveness in depression, 
whereby overall effective  ness was over  estimated in Intervention

Our review highlights several evidence gaps. Further 
research is needed to determine whether generic psycho -
logical interventions are effective in specific groups of incarcerated populations, such as people living with mental disorders other than substance misuse. Research suggests that tailored individualised interventions are associated with better treatment outcomes.
89 Furthermore, 
to improve transition to the community, future research should develop and evaluate the effects of follow-up treatments in the community after release. Greater consideration should be given to understanding the influence of environmental factors within prisons on treatment effects. Potential effects could be limited by the setting, because prisons are not primarily therapeutic environments and they prioritise security over health and rehabilitation needs.

Figure 5: Effectiveness of psychological interventions in prison for reducing recidivism, by intervention type

CBT=cognitive behavioural therapy.
Articleswww.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 8   September 2021  771possibility, research comparing the effectiveness of the 
same treatment modality in prison versus in a community setting could provide information on whether the prison environment sustains behavioural change and what adaptations could improve treatment effectiveness in prisons.
To our best knowledge, we report the first meta-
analysis of RCTs on the effectiveness of psychological 
inter  ventions delivered in prisons for recidivism 
outcomes. Some limitations should be noted. The study selection process leading up to the full-text screening stage was done by a single reviewer. The included trials were delivered in high-income countries. In addition, the number of included studies was not large (n=29), which underlines the legal, practical, and ethical challenges of doing high-quality research in prisons.
58,90,91 
One specific problem encountered in doing clinical research in these settings is high dropout rates, which often result in small and selective samples. Prisons have high turnover rates and participants are likely to be released or transferred unexpectedly.
92 Furthermore, 
despite limiting inclusion to the most robust study design of RCT, only two (7%) of 29 of the included studies had low risk of bias. The most affected domains 
were randomisation and deviations from the intended interventions. Difficulties associated with masking staff  and participants to the assigned intervention are likely to have contributed to an increased risk of bias in these two domains. There was also evidence of selective publication of small studies on the basis of their effect size (ie, some studies with small effect sizes were missing), which indicated that our initial pooled estimate of all studies (OR 0·72) was overestimated because of publication bias.
93 Sex-specific analyses com -
paring estimates in females and males could not be done, because of insufficient numbers of female-only samples.
In conclusion, we have provided a synthesis of current 
research on the effectiveness of psychological inter -
ventions delivered in prisons aimed at reducing post-release recidivism. We report modest effects, at best, for psychological interventions delivered in prison. Trials of therapeutic community interventions and 
related approaches that facilitate continuity of treatment after prison release should be prioritised. Considering high rates of recidivism
3,4 and the consequences for 
public health and safety,5,6 simple, large RCTs on the 
effectiveness of psychological interventions in prison are necessary.

Abstract
Vast arrays of research have evaluated recidivism through a limited scope, analyzing various factors independently. This study endeavors to execute a systematic review of factors attributed to recidivism in order to focus the research trajectory toward the most promising recidivism reduction tool. Various risk factors of recidivism have been identified; however few can be utilized as a tool in reduction. Of those tools, research indicates that 
correctional education programming appears to offer the greatest reduction outcome. 
The importance of this research is established by reorganizing the major research findings on correctional education programs from 1995 to 2010 in order to show the impact of education on recidivism. T o accomplish this goal, a typology of the research is created to delineate the factor that is most promising in reducing recidivism, correctional education. 
Specifically, an analysis of 10 empirical studies is performed in order to understand 
the impact of correctional education programming on recidivism. Findings reveal conclusiveness about educational programming as a reduction tool for recidivism.
Introduction
The incarceration rates in America far exceed all other industrialized nations, with over two million inmates currently incarcerated (Brazell, Crayton, Mukamal, Solomon, &

5Lindahl, 2009; Vacca, 2004). Approximately, 95% of those inmates will be released 
yearly (Brazell et al., 2009). Overcrowding has become a major issue for correctional facilities and has created major problems for the criminal justice system and our nation (Petersilia, 2003). Further, research states that one in every one hundred persons in the United States is currently incarcerated (Brazell et al., 2009). Major studies (Batiuk, Lahm, McKeever, Wilcox, & Wilcox, 2005; Vacca, 2004; Gordon & 
Weldon, 2003; Steurer, Smith, & Tracy, 2001; Hull, Forrester, Brown, Jobe, & McCullen, 
2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997) have been conducted that work toward relieving the problem of overcrowding by looking at effective correctional programming, which reduces the likeliness for inmates to return to prison. These studies have all unanimously concluded that correctional education, particularly college or academic, has a negative correlation with recidivism (Steurer, Linton, Nally, &  
Lockwood, 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; Vacca, 2004; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997).
Incarceration in America is a growing problem. As can be seen in Figure 1, 
prison populations, namely state and federal institutions, increased 55% from 1995 to 2010. It is this growing population of inmates that creates the need 
for programming that closes the revolving door of correctional institutions 
in America. The most recent recidivism study conducted in 1994 by the Department of Justice reports a national recidivism rate of 68% (Langan & Levin, 2002). This rate applies to prior offenders who were rearrested at three years post-release (Langan & Levin, 2002).

Correctional Education and Recidivism Lori L. Hall
6A general consensus among scholars suggests that correctional education 
plays a major role in the rehabilitation of inmates (Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 
2000; Batiuk et al., 2005; Vacca, 2004). There are various kinds of correctional programs aimed at providing rehabilitation to inmates (Steurer et al., 2010). Many researchers have discovered that correctional education often involves various programs, meaning that the variations of educational level among 
inmates has developed a need for many programs that serve the prospective 
inmates (Steurer et al., 2010). According to Steurer et al. (2010), education has three goals—to provide security, safety, and rehabilitation—and these goals are “the entire range of correctional services.” It is this similarity of goals that offers the most hope for the rehabilitation of inmates. The goals comparison, as stated by Steurer et al. (2010), work toward keeping society protected from offenders, 
insuring the security of institutions and aimed at creating functioning and 
productive members of society. Utilizing education as a means of accomplishing the goals of corrections allows for its use as a tool.
Petersilia (2003) states that societal forces, such as lawmakers and 
politicians, often combat the goals of correctional education by arguing that 
inmates should not be given access to education when society is obligated 
to pay for their education. This is often referred to as the “principle of least eligibility,” which suggests ambivalence among the public in providing inmates with specific programs that the general public is not granted freely (Petersilia, 2003). It is this societal and political influence that greatly hinders correctional education as a rehabilitative tool for inmates (Petersilia, 2003). However, as 
policy makers call for less funding for rehabilitative programs it encourages 
increased spending for more prisons and longer prison sentences (Steurer  et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009, Batiuk et al., 2005; Petersilia, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001). Consequently, recidivism rates are climbing and more money is used to re-incarcerate these inmates (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009, Batiuk et al., 2005; Petersilia, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001). According to Batiuk et al. 
(2005), in 1997 Ohio spent over $35 million on recidivating inmates at $47 per 
prisoner per day. Conversely, it has been reported that for every $962 spent on academic education for inmates the criminal justice system will save $5,306 per inmate (Brazell et al., 2009).
Previous research has shown that correctional education reduces recidivism, 
claiming gainful employment as the direct link to recidivism reduction (Steurer  
et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000). However, various risk factors exist that impact recidivism. This study aims to explore the relationship of correctional

7education and recidivism. To accomplish this, an examination of the risk factors of 
recidivism was performed, looking at education as a tool in reducing recidivism. Thus, a review of empirical studies analyzing correctional education programs and recidivism was conducted from 1995 to 2010. Using the information gained in this study as means, I propose some future goals of corrections.
Recidivism
Before delving into correctional education as a tool for recidivism reduction, it is important to discuss recidivism. Recidivism research is often a difficult topic to address. Researchers often debate the measures of recidivism in order to identify the indicators that offer the best predictors. A general consensus of literature identifies three measures of recidivism: re-arrest, re-conviction, and 
re-incarceration (Jancic, 1998). All the indicators alone offer several deleterious 
effects. Re-arrest, for example, often presumes guilt as well as assumes conviction and incarceration, yet this is not always the situation. According to Langan and Levin (2002), re-arrest is an incomplete measure for criminal activity because it assumes re-conviction. In a similar manner, re-conviction 
makes the supposition of re-incarceration, while other alternatives exist, 
such as probation. In a review of the literature, Chappell (2004) concluded that researchers typically define recidivism by three measures: re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration; however, researchers operationalize recidivism as re-incarceration. Researchers often argue that re-incarceration offers the most effective indicator of recidivism. However, problematic still, literature suggests 
that re-incarceration alone fails to account for occurrences that do not result in 
incarceration, meaning a return to crime has still occurred yet not so much as to warrant incarceration. For example, occurrences that lead to re-conviction but result in probation help explain the difficulties of using re-incarceration as a measure. Independently, these three indicators create an ineffective measure of recidivism. Nevertheless, when all indicators are integrated, a more efficient 
measure of recidivism is created.
In addition to understanding how researchers define recidivism, it is also 
important to address the risk factors that influence recidivism or an offender’s 
propensity to recidivate. Research (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 
2000) suggests many risk factors influence recidivism, specifically race, age, 
gender, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), educational attainment, and employment status. It is imperative that each risk factor be addressed independently, in order to comprehend its significance to recidivism research.

8Age
Current literature has shown that the age of offenders has an impact on recidivism (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000). Often, age is identified as a risk factor of recidivism. The most recent statistics available on recidivism rates collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics from prisoners released in 1994 
with a three-year follow-up was utilized in this study in order to show the risk 
factors of recidivism. According to Figure 2, as an offender ages the likelihood for that offender to return to crime at six months post-release reduces from 38.6% to 25.9% among the 21–30 years of age group. As well, this reduction in recidivism can be noted for all indicators utilizing follow-up periods ranging from six months to three years.
Understanding influences of age on recidivism is useful for predicting who 
recidivates. However, age is only a risk factor for recidivism and is not useful as a tool for reduction in that age cannot be manipulated in the same manner that employment status and educational levels can be. Rather, the understanding of this risk factor is vital to the prevention and reduction of recidivism. Other 
influences exist, such as maturation, which works at explaining the effect of age 
on recidivism. With increases in age, people often develop more stability, which

9leads to a reduction in criminal activity or desistance. This maturation provides 
some explanation of the influence of age on recidivism.
Race
Race is also a risk factor of recidivism, and is useful in the prediction of recidivism. According to Coley and Barton (2006), among all racial categories, 
blacks have the highest rates of incarceration. In addition, the highest rates of 
recidivism among all racial categories can be seen among blacks. According to Figure 3, among all indicator categories, blacks have the highest rates of re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration. Utilizing the Recidivism Analysis Tool from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, we see that among the re-arrest category, blacks have a recidivism rate of 77 .6% at three years post-release compared to 
69.3% recidivism among whites. Research shows other structural and cultural 
factors exist that have created the increase in incarceration and recidivism among blacks. Specifically, policies that target specific races, such as the war on crime policies, reflect higher incarceration rates among black men than any other racial category (Pettit & Western, 2004). Understanding the role of race in 
the prediction of recidivism is necessary for defining a reduction tool.

10Gender
Gender is another important factor in recidivism prediction. A risk factor as well, literature suggests that women have the lowest recidivism rates. Further, males have higher rates of incarceration and higher rates of recidivism (Coley & Barton, 2006). According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is shown that males have re-arrest rates at 50.6% versus female re-arrest rates at 42.9% at one year 
post-release. A comprehensive overview of the risk factors associated with 
recidivism is beneficial to determining what factors influence recidivism and how research should advance toward reduction tools. Importance is gained through an analytical understanding of recidivism risk factors in order to develop a high recidivism risk group for prediction purposes.
Marital Status
Research shows offenders who are married often have lower rates of recidivism than single offenders. In fact, literature states marital status as reducing crime and recidivism due to familial ties or bonds (Burton, Cullen, Evans, & Dunaway, 1994). According to Burton et al. (1994), these social bonds are a 
factor in reducing recidivism. Marital status as a factor of recidivism enables

11researchers to understand that through increased stability crime can be reduced. 
Comprehending the impact of these risk factors on recidivism is necessary for effective programming that reduces recidivism.
Employment/Educational Attainment
Unemployment is often a common factor that impedes the offender, often 
contributing to the offender’s choice of criminality. As well, offenders who 
struggle with finding gainful employment are more prone to criminal activity than those who find higher paying jobs (Chamberlain, 2011). Additionally, one factor that contributes to offenders’ difficulty in finding gainful employment is level of education, specifically low levels (Chamberlain, 2011). According to Harlow (2003), of the national population of inmates, 41% have not completed 
a general equivalency diploma (GED) or high school, compared to 18% of 
the general population. Along with lower levels of education comes reduced employability of offenders (Chamberlain, 2011). Employment as a risk factor begins the shift toward the establishment of a tool for recidivism reduction. Further, decreased opportunity for employment creates a need for offenders 
to resort to illegitimate behavior to generate income (Burton et al., 1994). At 
this point the risk factor of educational level arises as a factor of recidivism. Educational attainment of offenders is often thought of as a risk factor of recidivism among researchers. However, the distinction between educational attainment and previously discussed risk factors (age, gender, race, marital status, and employment) emerges in our ability to utilize education as a tool for 
reduction. Structurally, these risk factors (age, gender, race, and marital status) 
for recidivism allow some avenue for change. However, to accomplish this goal, policies would have to be created that reduce the likelihood of these factors influencing recidivism. More directly, education as a tool for recidivism reduction offers a more viable path through policy changes.
Education as a Reduction Tool
Education as a recidivism reduction tool can provide many benefits for the United States as a whole (Erisman & Contardo, 2005). Initially, the offender gains the most benefit from obtaining a correctional education (Erisman & Contardo, 2005). However, over time the benefit is then shared with the family, 
the correctional institution, and society (Erisman & Contardo, 2005). This benefit 
refers to a reduction of costs associated with incarcerating offenders, a reduction of strain on the offenders and their families, and an economic boost for society (Erisman & Contardo, 2005). The opportunity for education of inmates offers a

12link between employment and reduced recidivism (Gaes, 2008). Thus, an   
in-depth look at correctional education and recidivism is necessary.
Many states in the United States offer correctional education programs 
to inmates during incarceration (Stevens & Ward, 1997). However, a study 
conducted by Erisman and Contardo (2005) revealed that about 5% of inmates enroll in correctional education programming. Correctional education has a 
variety of goals that are aimed at rehabilitating inmates (Gordon & Weldon, 
2003). These goals often include controlling inmate behavior, supporting the needs of the correctional institution, and providing inmates with basic skills and an opportunity to change (Gordon & Weldon, 2003). However, researchers have unanimously decided that the ultimate goal of correctional education is to reduce recidivism (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; 
Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Petersilia, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000; 
Stevens & Ward, 1997).
According to the literature, correctional education significantly reduces 
inmates’ likelihood of returning to prison (recidivism). Specifically, the level of education obtained while incarcerated and whether the inmate participated or 
completed education programming determines the rate of recidivism (Harlow, 
2003; Wilson, Gallagher, & MacKenzie, 2000). In a meta-analysis of 15 studies, researchers examined the correlation between participation and completion of post-secondary correctional education and recidivism (Chappell, 2004). It was shown that those inmates who completed a post-secondary correctional education program had lower rates of recidivism than did participants only 
(Chappell, 2004). The relationship between participation and completion of 
correctional education programs is important to the role of education as a tool for reduction of recidivism. Specifically, the importance of degree completion while incarcerated further aids in the reduction of recidivism rather than participation only.
Methods
This assessment of the association between correctional education programming and recidivism is based on empirical research studies published from 1995 to 2010. This date range was determined due to the lack of  
analysis of the research studies conducted for this time period. Further, the 
researcher utilized the publication date of all studies and realizes that most,  
if not all, of the research conducted was done on samples from the 1990s.

13combinations of search terms ( recidivism, recidiv*  and education, correctional 
education programming, prison education  and recidiv* )1 focusing on the concept 
of the study were appropriated. Databases (ProQuest, JSTOR, and EBSCOhost) 
that are relevant to the discipline of sociology and criminology/criminal justice 
were utilized over the course of a three-year period (2010–2013) in order to 
identify new and relevant articles. Across all searches completed, hundreds of results were returned. Utilizing systematic content analysis, the researcher was able to narrow the sample size to 10 articles. Specifically, criteria were used to aid in this process. Two major criterions were used to eliminate research studies.
The first criterion for use was whether the article contained within it a 
primary empirical study looking at correctional education programming. For the purpose of this study, correctional education programming refers to a program that leads toward a diploma, certificate, or degree of any sort. This can include a high school diploma, a GED, vocational and technical training certificates, and college degrees. In many studies, elimination was problematic despite the fact 
that many empirical studies looking at correctional education programming 
have been conducted. The difficulty in elimination of studies that appeared suitable arose from the vast research on correctional education program evaluation and effectiveness.
The second criterion was whether or not the study used recidivism as 
an outcome measure. Specifically, the studies included must have measured individual recidivism of offenders while controlling for their participation in a correctional education program. Recidivism as an outcome measure can often be difficult to measure. Many studies exist that look at recidivism; however, only studies relating to correctional education programming that uses recidivism as an outcome measure were included in the study 
to assess the influence of correctional education programs on recidivism. 
Researchers often define recidivism as a “return to.” Customarily, recidivism is measured in three ways: re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration (Jancic, 1998; Chappell, 2004). Recently, researchers have included two other indicators of recidivism: self-reported offenses and violations of community supervision (Cecil, Drapkin, MacKenzie, & Hickman, 2000). For 
the purpose of this study, studies including any measure of recidivism were 
included.

14Limitations
Some limitations exist in this study of correctional education and recidivism research that are beyond the control of the researcher. First, inclusion of only 10 studies available and appropriate for use in this review offered some dissatisfaction to the researcher. Initially, searches performed offered some satisfaction to the researcher due to vast amounts of results returned on 
correctional education and recidivism research. However, once the two criterions 
were applied, the sample size was reduced drastically. Second, another limitation that is beyond the control of the researcher is the lack of empirical research conducted from 2005 to 2010. Originally, the researcher allowed a date range of 1995 to 2010; however, no empirical studies fitting the criteria were discovered since 2005. A vast array of knowledge can be derived from correctional 
education research, often program evaluation or effectiveness is measured.  
As stated earlier, only studies that use recidivism as an outcome measure  were included in the sample.
Third, recidivism is difficult to measure and contains within it many problem 
areas. Criminological researchers debate the issue of recidivism measures 
frequently. Outcome measures utilized as indicators of recidivism are re-arrest, 
re-conviction, and re-incarceration. However, Jancic (1998) argues deleterious effects of the three indicators, as stated previously. Re-arrest is problematic because it presumes re-conviction and re-incarceration. The critical point arises due to the indicative nature of guilt offered by using re-arrest as an indicator. Further, re-conviction also proves presumptuous of re-incarceration. Finally,  
re-incarceration can be problematic to measure across jurisdictional lines, such 
as state to state and state to federal.
Analysis
The sample collected includes 10 studies that examine correctional education programs and recidivism. The purpose of this research is to create a 
comprehensive, although not exhaustive, review of the empirical studies 
conducted from 1995 to 2010 on correctional education and their findings on recidivism. What follows is a detailed account of the study carried out, looking at specific measures, sample size, levels of education, and the recidivism rates reported. Figure 5 shows the results of this study.
Steurer et al. (2001) conducted one of the largest studies ever that looked 
at correctional education and recidivism. Steurer et al. (2001) used a sample of 3,1 70 inmates currently incarcerated and ready to be released between 1997 and 1998 with a follow-up period of three years in order to effectively measure

18whether or not correctional education programs had any effect on recidivism. 
Like other researchers looking at correctional education and recidivism, Steurer et al. (2001) used a quasi-experimental design that focused on release cohorts. The researchers conducted a randomized sampling technique to extract inmates’ names that would be released during the study time frame from three states: Minnesota, Ohio, and Maryland (Steurer et al., 2001). This process was 
performed until each state had a sample size of 1,200 (n = 1,200) inmates. 
Oversampling was used in order to control for early releases. Of the sample drawn, 1,797 inmates had not participated in any correctional education, while 1,373 inmates had participated in some form of correctional education. While the study has some issues with generalizability, no other study has gathered the amount of information Steurer et al. (2001) have, with over 500 variables that 
look at various factors that influence recidivism, as well as control for reliability 
and comparability.
The Three State Recidivism Study claims that the greatest hindrance to the 
validity of the study is similar to all other studies that have been conducted on inmates and correctional education programs, and that factor is the self-
selection bias (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk et al., 2005; Vacca, 
2004; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000). Due to the nature of correctional programs, in that they are offered and not mandated, researchers are unable to conduct studies using truly random sampling techniques due to the voluntary participation or nonparticipation of inmates in these programs (Steurer et al., 2010; Batiuk et al, 2005; Steurer et al., 2001; Hull 
et al., 2000). The outcome measures that the researchers used were re-arrest, 
re-conviction, and re-incarceration (recidivism) (Steurer et al., 2001). This working definition of recidivism as an outcome measure contains limitations in that re-arrest does not mean guilt and therefore could be misconstrued as recidivism if measured (Jancic, 1998). As well, using re-conviction as a measure of recidivism provides limitations in the research that imply re-incarceration, in which many 
cases do not result in incarceration (Jancic, 1998). Researchers often find it 
difficult to conclude on a working definition of recidivism. Esperian (2010) argues that recidivism is “a return to criminal behavior.” However, the problem with this definition is that it fails to take into account the “dark figure of crime” and only allows for the measure of crime that is actually reported (Jancic, 2004).
From the research conducted by Steurer et al. (2001), it can be concluded 
that those inmates who participated in some form of correctional education had higher rates of reduced recidivism than inmates who did not participate. For Maryland and Ohio, the greatest reduction in recidivism can be seen among

Lori L. Hall Correctional Education and Recidivism
19the re-incarceration rates from 37% to 31% (see Figure 5) and from 31% to 24% 
(Steurer et al., 2001), while Minnesota saw the greatest reduction in negative post-release behaviors (recidivism) among re-arrest with rates dropping from 54% to 42% (Steurer et al., 2001). The researchers provide no differentiation between programs completed by inmates and the respective recidivism (Steurer et al., 2001). Therefore, it is hard to determine what educational level has the 
greatest impact on post-release behaviors. However, some interesting findings 
reported by Steurer et al. (2001) were that among the two groups (participants and nonparticipants), nonparticipants had completed higher levels of education prior to incarceration. This leaves questions as to what relationship exists between pre-incarceration education and during incarceration education on recidivism.
Other studies that sought to discover what relationship exists between type 
of correctional education and recidivism have been conducted. More specifically, Hull et al. (2000) looked at inmates who participated in academic and vocational education and those who did not (Hull et al., 2000). The researchers in this study also examined the effects of participation and completion of these academic 
and vocational programs on recidivism (Hull et al., 2000). This differentiation 
between participation and completion is an important finding in looking at correctional education and recidivism. In order to better understand the effects that correctional education has on recidivism it is imperative that we differentiate between participation and completion of correctional education. Hull et al. (2000) examined 3,000 inmates in the Virginia Department of 
Corrections between 1979 and 1994. Of those inmates, 1,307 inmates neither 
participated in nor completed any type of correctional education (Hull et al., 2000). Hull et al. (2000) also examined the relationship between academic or vocational participators and academic or vocational completers, looking specifically at the influence on recidivism. Interestingly, the results show that completers, of either academic or vocational programs have lower rates of 
recidivism than those inmates who only participated in these programs but did 
not complete (Hull et al., 2000). In an examination of recidivism rates it becomes evident that inmates who complete either academic or vocational correctional education have lower recidivism rates than inmates who participate but do not complete academic or vocational correctional education (Hull et al., 2000). More 
specifically, inmates who participated in academic correctional education had 
recidivism rates of 38.2% versus 19.1% for inmates who completed academic correctional education programs (see Figure 5) (Hull et al., 2000). Among all groups examined by Hull et al. (2000), academic completers had the lowest

20rates of recidivism. This distinction between completers and participators offers 
further understanding of the relationship between correctional education and recidivism.
In a study conducted by Gordon and Weldon (2003), researchers focused 
on exploring the relationship between type of program and recidivism. Gordon and Weldon (2003) examined 193 inmates in the Huttonsville Correctional 
Facility in West Virginia from 1999 to 2000. The researchers divided inmates 
into three groups: inmates who did not participate in any correctional education programs (control group), inmates who completed a general education equivalency (GED) and then participated in a vocational education program, and inmates who completed a vocational program (Gordon & Weldon, 2003). The rate of recidivism among the control group was 26% (Gordon & Weldon, 2003). 
However, those inmates who completed vocational education programs had a 
recidivism rate of 8.75% (see Figure 5) (Gordon & Weldon, 2003). This finding shows that there is a relationship between correctional education and recidivism and that relationship shows inmates who receive correctional education will have lower rates of recidivism than inmates who receive no correctional 
education (Gordon & Weldon, 2003). This finding is consistent with the study 
conducted by Steurer et al. (2001), as well as other studies (Steurer et al., 2010; Batiuk et al., 2005; Hull et al., 2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997).
It is also imperative to understand the type of programs that have a greater 
effect on recidivism. Batiuk et al. (2005) explored that relationship (type of program and recidivism). In the study, Batiuk et al. (2005) selected 972 (n = 972) 
inmates from the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (ODCR) 
using a disproportionate stratified sampling technique in order to improve the representativeness of the sample to the population. The researchers divided the inmates into subgroups before using random sampling to extract the sample groups from each (Batiuk et al., 2005). The subgroups were those inmates who had participated in high school diploma/GED programs, vocational programs, 
and college education programs; as well as a control group of inmates who had 
not completed any correctional education programs (Batiuk et al., 2005). Once the inmates had been divided into their respective subgroups, random sampling procedures were used to create the sample (Batiuk et al., 2005). From the study (Batiuk et al., 2005), it was determined that inmates who participate in college 
education programs while incarcerated have lower rates of recidivism and the 
time to recidivism is longer than any other correctional education program rates, which can been seen in Figure 5. However, one limitation of the study, like previous studies, is the self-selection bias (Batiuk et al., 2005). Studies (Steurer  
The Journal of Correctional Education 66(2) • May 2015
Lori L. Hall Correctional Education and Recidivism
21et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000; Batiuk et al., 2005; Vacca, 2004) suggest inmates 
who choose to participate in college correctional education have more self-discipline and motivation than inmates who choose not to participate in correctional education programming. This factor has not been examined in the research and could influence the relationship between correctional education and recidivism (Batiuk et al., 2005).
In a previous study conducted a decade earlier, the same findings were 
revealed (Stevens & Ward, 1997). Stevens and Ward (1997) argue that inmates who receive a college degree while incarcerated will have lower recidivism rates, as seen in Figure 5. In a study conducted by Stevens and Ward (1997) of 60 inmates released in 1991 who had completed either a two-year or four-year degree it was revealed that the level of education significantly affects 
recidivism. In fact, of the inmates who had received a four-year degree during 
incarceration, none had recidivated during the three-year follow-up period (Stevens & Ward, 1997). Similar findings have been discovered in other studies concluding that inmates who receive a two-year or four-year degree during incarceration have lower rates of recidivism (Stevens & Ward, 1997). Stevens 
and Ward (1997) also conducted a survey of states in order to examine the 
research on correctional education and recidivism. Only eight states returned the surveys sent by Stevens and Ward (1997), yet the findings all reflect  
that correctional education reduces recidivism. Those states were Texas,  
New York, Illinois, Alabama, Florida, Maryland, and Oklahoma (Stevens &  
Ward, 1997).
The survey from Alabama revealed that of the inmates who completed a 
post-secondary education degree while incarcerated, recidivism rates were at 1% compared to the overall rate of 35% (Stevens & Ward, 1997). Stevens and Ward (1997) also determined from the Florida survey that inmates who received some form of correctional education were 19% more likely to find employment when released, arguing that employment reduces recidivism (Stevens & Ward, 
1997). The relationship between employment and recidivism is important in 
understanding what works in reducing recidivism. However, that research is beyond the scope of this article (see Saylor & Gaes 1997; Uggen 2000; Morash & Andersen 1978). Surveys conducted by Stevens and Ward (1997) from New York, Maryland, Texas, Alabama, Illinois, and Oklahoma all revealed that inmates who 
complete a college degree during incarceration have lower rates of recidivism 
than all other inmates.
Burke and Vivian (2001) examined inmates at the Hampden County 
Correctional Center (HCCC) in a comparison study of those who participated in 
The Journal of Correctional Education 66(2) • May 2015
Correctional Education and Recidivism Lori L. Hall
22college education programs and those who did not. Recidivism was measured 
as re-incarceration, as adapted from the definition set forth by the HCCC. Using a sample size of 64 inmates ( n = 64) the researchers gathered information 
from the jail management system in order to collect specific data on inmates to determine inclusion of inmates in the sample. Inclusion criteria included release dates of January to October 1993, serving a sentence of at least three months, 
and completion of at least three college credits or no college credits (Burke & 
Vivian, 2001). From the sample, two groups were created: inmates who had participated in college correctional education (treatment) and inmates who had not participated in college correctional education (control). The sample included 32 inmates in each group. From the study, it was concluded that inmates who participate in college correctional education program have lower recidivism 
rates than inmates who do not participate in college education programs 
while incarcerated. Specifically, a 22% reduction, as seen in Figure 5, can be examined among the groups (Burke & Vivian, 2001). As well, it was observed that of those inmates who participate in college education programs, there is a longer length of time to recidivism than those who did not participate, with 
the average length reported at 4.38 years compared with 3.13 years (Burke & 
Vivian, 2001). Some limitations of the study are sample size and the limitation of one institution. Generally, researchers claim that sample sizes below 100 are often unreliable.
Brewster and Sharp (2002) addressed the problem of sample size by 
examining a sample of 11,813. In order to study the effect of obtaining a GED 
while incarcerated, looking at the impact it has on recidivism, Brewster and 
Sharp (2002) pooled data from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Initially, the sample of offenders released between January 1991 and December 1994 contained 21,268 inmates. Through inclusion criteria the researchers were able to reduce the sample to a group of inmates, looking at the effects of GED on recidivism (n = 5,752). Recidivism data was gathered through January 1997, 
with a follow-up period of three years. Controlling for age, race, and marital 
status, the researchers report a reduction in recidivism among inmates who participated in GED programs while incarcerated in the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (Brewster & Sharp, 2002). This finding, as well as others, leads to a more thorough understanding of the impact of education on recidivism.
In a study conducted by Kelso, Jr. (2000), two correctional education centers 
were examined to determine the effect of educational level on recidivism. The Garrett Heyns Study gathered a sample of 147 inmates who had participated in high school, vocational training, or college programs before release between

Lori L. Hall Correctional Education and Recidivism
231985 to 1987 (Kelso, Jr., 2000). The researcher reported at one year post-release 
there was a recidivism rate of 0% among those who had completed a high school diploma. Further, after five years post-release of inmates in the high school completion group, the recidivism rate average was 19.6% (Kelso, Jr., 2000). For those inmates who received a vocational certificate, recidivism rates at five years post-release were reduced to 11.9%. More importantly, college 
degree recipients were reported to have recidivism rates, as seen in Figure 5, at 
just 10.8% at five years post-release (Kelso, Jr., 2000). In the second sample, the Twin Rivers Study contained 152 inmates who completed either a vocational certificate or associate degree program. Of those, the researcher reports a recidivism rate of 9% among inmates obtaining an associate’s degree while those obtaining a vocational certificate had a recidivism rate of 14% (Kelso, Jr., 
2000). Overall, inmates who participated in some form of correctional education 
programming at five years post-release had a lower recidivism rate compared with the 53.7% recidivism rate of the entire population (Kelso, Jr., 2000). Further, the results offer more evidence of the relationship between correctional education and recidivism. Additionally, the research continues to show reduction 
of recidivism through education as a tool.
Nuttall, Hollmen, and Staley (2003) performed a study of inmates at the 
New York State Department of Correctional Services (NYSDOCS) released in 
1996 with a three-year follow-up period. The inmates were divided into three groups: inmates who obtained a GED at NYSDOCS, inmates who were admitted and released without a degree, and inmates who entered with a degree, with 
a final sample size of 16,61 7 . Of the three inmate groups, Figure 5 shows those 
who earned a GED while in the NYSDOCS had the lowest recidivism group at 31.8% compared with those who did not obtain a degree at 36.6% (Nuttall et al., 2003). Further, those who were admitted with a degree had a recidivism rate of 32%. The results, like previously, provide support for the claims made by all the research examined in this study that as a tool correctional education, specifically 
college, works at reducing recidivism.
Additionally, Batiuk, Moke, and Rountree (1997) performed a 10-year 
follow-up study of 318 (n = 318) inmates in Ohio. Further, inmates released 
from 1982 to 1983 and followed through 1993 were included. The researchers measured recidivism as a return to prison and examined college participants 
and employment outcomes. From the study, the researchers report an overall 
recidivism rate of 37%. As well, the researchers discuss the effect of education on recidivism indirectly through the obtainment of employment rather than education as the sole factor. This provides support for further research on

24employment, education, and recidivism of inmates. Figure 5 shows the results 
of the study conducted by Batiuk et al. (1997). Overall, Batiuk et al. (1997) claim education is a factor in the reduction of recidivism and increases the offender’s employability and likelihood of obtaining gainful employment.
From the extant research, it can be concluded that education works as a 
reduction tool for recidivism. More importantly, it is gathered that education has 
an indirect effect on recidivism reduction through increases in the employability 
of inmates. For a comprehensive overview of the sample (n = 10) of empirical research analyzed in this project, refer to Figure 5. From Figure 5, it becomes evident education as a tool for reduction is promising. Further, a discussion claiming the usefulness of education as a tool for reduction follows.
Policy Implications
Throughout the last 30 years, correctional education research has emerged that exhibits evidence of which correctional education reduces recidivism. Examination of a myriad of studies reveals conclusive results: correctional education reduces recidivism (Steurer et al., 2010; Brazell et al., 2009; Batiuk 
et al., 2005; Vacca, 2004; Gordon & Weldon, 2003; Steurer et al., 2001; 
Hull et al., 2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997). Further, research that investigates previous studies in order to reexamine the findings reveals identical results (Gaes, 2008; Chappell, 2004; Wilson et al., 2000; Bouffard, MacKenzie, & Hickman, 2000). The research findings from the extant research conclude that all forms of correctional education reduces recidivism; more specifically, 
college education during incarceration has the greatest impact on recidivism. 
The issue at hand is concerned with a review of the research on correctional education and the impact on recidivism, particularly the overall findings of empirical research.
Understanding the relationship between correctional programs, specifically 
education programs, and recidivism is important for learning tools to reduction. 
The extant research provides insight as to which educational programs aid in 
reducing recidivism. As well, it also provides a research base for which other studies can be developed to help fill the gaps. This project systematically reviewed the empirical research that examined the correlation between correctional education programs, looking at the factors’ influence on recidivism. It was concluded that 
inmates who obtain a correctional education degree while incarcerated will have 
lower rates of recidivism. The research that has been conducted brings forth questions as to what else can be done to aid in the reduction of recidivism utilizing education as a tool. The research explains the relationship between correctional

Lori L. Hall Correctional Education and Recidivism
25education and recidivism; specifically, if we educate prisoners, recidivism will be 
reduced. With this knowledge of education as a tool for recidivism reduction there leaves the question of where we go from here.
It is evident that education is a tool which administrators and educators 
alike can utilize in the reduction of recidivism. Education as a correctional practice has been around for over 200 years (Crayton & Neusteter, 2008). It 
is recognized as one of the first programs in the rehabilitation of inmates and 
continually produces reduction of recidivism through employability of inmates (Crayton & Neusteter, 2008).
The major consensus among the research concludes that correctional 
education reduces recidivism (Steurer et al., 2001; Hull et al., 2000; Batiuk et al., 2005; Vacca, 2004; Stevens & Ward, 1997). As well, higher levels of 
education, such as two year and four-year degrees further decrease recidivism 
of inmates (Batiuk et al., 2005; Hull et al, 2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997). It has been concluded specifically that post-secondary correctional education offers the greatest reduction in recidivism than any other correctional education program (Batiuk et al., 2005; Hull et al., 2000; Stevens & Ward, 1997). However, 
administrators and policy makers have failed to understand this finding and 
continue to support the elimination of funding for inmates. This elimination of funding virtually ended correctional college education programs in many states (Batiuk et al., 2005). When policy makers haphazardly enact policies that contradict the findings in research, they are essentially setting offenders up for failure and those affected by these polices (families, institutions, society, etc.). 
Policy makers need to re-evaluate current policies that have eliminated funding 
for inmates to receive college education in order to reduce recidivism.
Where we go from here
This discussion of correctional education’s impact on recidivism leads to the question: where do we go from here? The implications of this study reveal the 
need of funding for correctional education programs for inmates. However, 
political practices have continually sought to eliminate funding despite these findings. According to Latessa (2004), political change is a difficult topic to address; specifically, the idea of why political will continually seeks to eliminate funding for correctional education. One claim is that politicians seek avenues of 
little risk taking and with correctional education the risk is high (Latessa, 2004). 
Research affirms this claim due to the lack of methodologically sound empirical studies on correctional education and recidivism. Specifically, empirical studies that have been conducted all contain within them methodological limitations

26due to a lack of controls for risk factors of recidivism. Of the 10 studies used 
in this project, none of them controlled for all the risk factors of recidivism (age, race, gender, marital status, employment, and educational attainment). Rather, few to little controls were used in the studies. As well, other factors not addressed were motivation and discipline of inmates in their decision to participate in correctional education programs.
In order to influence political changes, research needs to be 
methodologically sound. One solution to a methodologically sound study of correctional education and recidivism research would include controls for all the risk factors of recidivism. By controlling for age, race, and gender, the researcher can eliminate the influence of structural inequalities that exist in the occurrences of crime. Using controls for marital status, the influence of the strength of social 
bonds or familial ties is reduced as well. Further, by controlling for employment 
the researcher can establish whether or not strain was a factor in crime commission. Without controlling for the risk factors of recidivism, causation cannot be established. Thus, our research base is left with simply a correlation between correctional education and recidivism.
Additionally, determining an appropriate measure of recidivism is a key 
factor in developing a sound methodology for recidivism research. Many measures of recidivism have been indicated in the research, such as re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration. However, as discussed previously, these measures are often problematic in that, when measured independently, they fail to account for some criminal activity. One solution is to first determine 
an adequate definition of recidivism. Many researchers agree that recidivism 
can be defined as a “return to” (Brazell, 2009; Chappell, 2004). Utilizing this definition and applying it to the criminal justice policy of “innocent until proven guilty,” researchers can develop an appropriate measure of recidivism. For example, conviction is commonly the indicator of guilt in the U.S. criminal justice system. Therefore, re-conviction would be the most suitable measure of 
recidivism in that it captures (compared to the other indicators) the most crime.
Accomplishing the task of creating a methodologically sound research study 
of correctional education and recidivism is one step toward changing the political 
policies that have eliminated funding. However, the influence of empirical research on political changes still contains issues. First, public opinion greatly 
influences political will and the trajectory with which policies flow. The task of 
changing public opinion is insurmountable, especially due to the lack of influence of empirical research on the views of the public. For example, despite the large body of research that exists regarding the hazards of smoking, some portions

27of the population still continue this behavior. Policy changes appear to have 
the greatest impact on public behaviors, such as nonsmoking policies, when advocates begin to vocalize their support or nonsupport of specific interests.
There is little doubt that the politics of correctional education has 
influenced the lack of funding for programs. In 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA), which 
was monumental in the elimination of funding for inmates to participate in 
correctional education. Shortly after, many education programs were closed by states lacking financial support of these programs (Brazell, 2009). At the same time, the VCCLEA allowed funding to be allocated to other criminal justice departments. The continual shifting of funds from department to department is an example of the politics at work in the funding of correctional 
education programs. However, the haphazardness of political fluctuations 
creates many detrimental results. The issue of funding in any arena is certainly a political game. In the area of corrections, the issue is heightened due to the perceived population that benefits from increased funding.
This certainly raises the question of who benefits from increased funding 
for correctional education. Initially, the offender receives the most benefit for increased education. This benefit is then shared with the offenders’ family through increased contributions. The benefit continues to influence society through economic boosts and through reduced costs of re-incarceration. Essentially, everyone benefits from correctional education. Through this logic, therefore, increased funding for correctional education benefits everyone.
As shown, research for correctional education and the impact on recidivism 
is still needed. Emphasis on research that is methodologically sound is important in order to influence public policy to increase funding for correctional education. From the research base, it can be determined that correctional education reduces recidivism through increased employability. It is important for researchers to explore the role of employment on recidivism. More importantly, 
understanding the relationship between correctional employment programs 
and recidivism is needed. A call for more research on correctional programs, education and employment, and their impact on recidivism is imperative.

Faith-based organizations administer many of the prison-based pro-
grams aimed at reducing recidivism. Many of these organizations
also manage treatment programs for substance abusers, at-risk juve-
niles, and ex-offenders. Much of the research on religiosity and delin-
quency indicates that the two are inversely related. Therefore, it seems
plausible that faith-based programs, which are rooted in religious
organizations, may be effective tools for reducing deviant and crimi-
nal behavior. However, it is unclear whether the empirical evidence
supports such a claim. This study is an evidence-based assessment of
the effectiveness of faith-based programs for reducing recidivism. The
results of this study indicate that faith-based programs ‘‘work’’ to
reduce recidivism. Directions for future research are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout the history of the United State s, religion has been inextricably tied to
our penal system. The penitentiary was founded on the premise that offenders
should not only be punished, but should have the opportunity to repent from
their deviant behavior. Early correctional efforts centered on Judeo-Christian

principles in an effort to reform prisoners. Upon entering the peniten tiary, prison-
ers were given a Bible and housed primarily in solitude. The goal was to allow pris-
oners time for spiritual reflection in which they offered penitence to God and
sought forgiveness. Spiritual transformation was considered the best defense
against future offending; therefore, religion was the primary mechanism for
explaining and controlling criminal behavior. By the 20th century, scientific
knowledge replaced religion as the paradigm for explaining and controlling crimi-
nal behavior (Clear, Hardyman, Stout, Lucken, & Dammer, 2000). As a result, reli-
gion was no longer considered the best method for correcting or managing crime.
During the 21st century, correctional ideology shifted back toward
religious strategies for addressing crime. Conservative politics and the
inability of science to ‘‘cure’’ criminal behavior were the primary catalysts
for a ‘‘religious comeback’’ (Clear et al., 2000, p. 54). Today, religious orga-
nizations administer many of the prison-based programs aimed at reducing
recidivism. Additionally, many religious organizations also manage treatment
programs for substance abusers, at-risk juveniles, and ex-offenders. How-
ever, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support the claim that
faith-based programs are effective in reducing recidivism or preventing crimi-
nal behavior. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness
of faith-based programs in reducing recidivism.
FAITH-BASED INITIATIVES
Faith-based initiatives can best be described as social programs or services that
are administered by an organization with some type of religious affiliation.
Faith-based programs fall under the umbrella of what is known as ‘‘intentional
religion.’’ Intentional religion refers to ‘‘the exposure to religion one receives
at a particular time in life for a particular purpose’’ (Johnson, Tompkins, &
Webb, 2002, p. 8). Stated another way, individuals are intentionally placed
in or receive treatment within a religious organization to meet a specific need.
Some examples include: (a) prisoners who participate in a Christian-based
prison program that emphasizes prayer, Bible study, and spiritual transform-
ation as a way to avoid future offending; (b) at-risk juveniles are matched with
volunteer mentors from a religious organization with the goal of helping the
juvenile avoid delinquent behavior; and (c) drug addicts who enroll in
faith-based conversion drug rehabilitation programs to achieve sobriety or
avoid relapse (Johnson et al., 2002). In summary, faith-based programs offer
the same or similar types of rehabilitation programs and services as secular
programs, the primary difference being some type of religious component.
Background
In 1996, former President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Res-
ponsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act. One of the key368 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
guidelines of this legislation is the Charitable Choice (Section 104) provision.
The provision has three primary goals: (a) to encourage states to expand
the involvement of community and faith-based organizations in the public
antipoverty effort; (b) to protect the religious integrity and character of
faith-based organizations that are willing to accept government funds to pro-
vide services to underserved populations, such as the poor and needy; and
(c) to preserve the religious freedom of individuals who seek assistance from
faith-based organizations. Charitable Choice extended governmental funding
to faith-based organizations, which was a radical departure from previous
provisions that had excluded governmental funding to religious organiza-
tions. Even so, Charitable Choice went virtually unnoticed until George W.
Bush campaigned to expand its provisions during his 2000 presidential bid.
As one of his first acts as president, Bush signed an executive order cre-
ating the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives
(OFBCI). The primary reason for creating the OFBCI was to create ‘‘a more
open and competitive Federal grant-making process [that would] increase
the delivery of effective social services to those whose needs are greatest’’
(White House Faith-Based & Community Initiative, 2001, para. 2). To facili-
tate the faith-based initiative, centers have been established in seven federal
agencies including the United States Departments of Justice, Agriculture,
Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and the Agency for International Development. The primary
responsibility of these centers is to promote faith-based initiatives, which
includes supporting organizations that provide assistance to people in need,
especially organizations that serve at-risk youth, prisoners, the elderly, the
homeless, substance abusers, and welfare-to-work families.
The Bush Administration made the claim that federal regulations and
restrictions resulted in faith-based organizations being discriminated against
when seeking federal funding for their social service programs. According to
one report, the administration accused federal agencies of discrimination
against faith-based organizations and asserted that nonprofit organizations
have long enjoyed a monopoly on federal grant money without having to
prove their effectiveness (Wilhelm, 2001). The Bush Administration proposed
that Charitable Choice provisions be expanded to include all federal social
services programs, and that federal regulatory barriers prohibiting religious
organizations from competing for government funds should be removed.
In response to Bush’s effort to engage both faith-based and community-
based organizations in social services programs, Representative J.C. Watts
(R-Oklahoma) introduced The Community Solutions Act in 2001 (H.R. 7).
This new legislation included the expansion of the Charitable Choice pro-
visions. Originally, Charitable Choice only covered state programs imple-
mented under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
Charitable Choice programs covered under this provision include food
stamps, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In addition,Evidence-Based Assessment of Faith-Based Programs 369Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
community and faith-based organizations may provide work programs (e.g.,
on-the-job training, job-skills training, and GED programs), food programs
(e.g., food pantries, subsidized meals, and shopping), maternity homes for
unmarried minor mothers or expectant mothers who cannot stay with their
parents, and medical and health services (e.g., abstinence education, drug
and alcohol treatment, vocational rehabilitation, and health clinics). Under
the Watts proposal, Charitable Choice would have extended assistance to state,
community, and faith-based organizations under a variety of social services.
It is no surprise that the proposal to expand faith-based initiatives
sparked controversy. The primary point of contention seemed to be whether
the federal government should allow religious-based organizations to apply
and compete for federal grants. Opponents have argued that funding
faith-based programs violates the constitutional principle of ‘‘separation of
church and state’’ (Feldmann, 2003, p. 2). However, others have argued that
Charitable Choice was consistent with the most recent ruling of the U.S.
Supreme Court regarding separation of church and state in Mitchell v. Helms
(2000). In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that government funded computers
could go to parochial schools, as long as the assistance is available to public
and private secular schools as well. The Court ruled that the government may
support faith-based organizations if the rationale is to further a legitimate
secular goal —improving literacy rates, for example —but not to advance reli-
gion (Loconte & John, 2001). Faith-based initiatives do attempt to address a
legitimate secular goal, namely crime prevention. Based on this ruling, it
could be argued that the funding of faith-based programs does not appear
to violate ‘‘separation of church and state.’’
Others have argued that the Charitable Choice provision would allow
religious organizations to discriminate in their hiring practices. For example,
Christian institutions may retain the right not to hire individuals who do not
profess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Opponents of the bill claim this
amounts to federally funded employment discrimination, which is unconsti-
tutional (Loconte & John, 2001). After serious debate on the expansion of
Charitable Choice provisions, H.R. 7 passed the House, but failed to pass
the Senate.
In an attempt to salvage some elements of his Faith-Based and Com-
munity Initiatives, President Bush, along with Senators Joseph Liberman
(D-Connecticut) and Rick Santorum (R-Pennsylvania), put forth a compro-
mise version to H.R. 7 (S 1924), the Charity Aid, Recovery and Empowerment
Act (CARE) of 2002. The CARE Act emphasizes tax incentives for greater
donations to charity, rather than expanding Charitable Choice. This revised
bill passed both the Senate and House and was touted as a Bush Administra-
tion victory, but in reality it did very little to further the national faith-based
initiative.
In February 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order
that changed the name of the White House Office of Faith-Based and370 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
Community Initiatives to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neigh-
borhood Partnerships. The mission of this agency is to:
Bring together leaders and experts in fields related to the work of
faith-based and neighborhood organizations in order to: identify best
practices and successful modes of delivering social services; evaluate
the need for improvements in the implementation and coordination of
public policies relating to faith-based and other neighborhood organiza-
tions; and make recommendations to the President, through the Execu-
tive Director, for changes in policies, programs, and practices that
affect the delivery of services by such organizations and the needs of
low-income and other underserved persons in communities at home
and around the world. (Executive Order 13199 Amended, 2009, para. 12)
RELIGIOSITY AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR
Researchers have argued that individuals who are involved in religious orga-
nizations are less likely to be involved in criminal behavior (Burkett, 1977,
1980; Higgins & Albrecht, 1977). However, Hirschi and Stark (1969) muddied
the empirical waters regarding the relationship between religiosity and delin-
quent behavior with their landmark study, ‘‘Hellfire and Delinquency.’’ The
researchers examined a random sample ( n¼4,077) of students from public
junior and senior high schools in Contra Costa County, California in 1964.
Hirschi and Stark (1969) hypothesized that juveniles who believed in the con-
cepts of ‘‘sin’’ and ‘‘hell,’’ and who attended church and Sunday school, were
less likely to commit delinquent acts. Religiosity was measured by church
attendance (e.g., frequent attendance, at least once a month, and infrequent
attendance, less than once a month). Delinquency was measured using
police records (i.e., official number of offenses committed in the previous
three years) and self-report data. The self-report delinquency index consisted
of six items (e.g., petty and grand larceny, auto theft, vandalism, drug use,
and assault). Contrary to expectations, the researchers found that frequent
church-goers and ‘‘students who believe in the Devil and in life after death
are as likely to commit delinquency as are students who do not believe in
a supernatural world’’ (Hirschi & Stark, 1969, p. 210).
In a replication of Hirschi and Stark’s study, Burkett and White (1974)
examined a random sample ( n¼855) of high school seniors from the Pacific
Northwest. They also hypothesized that juveniles who attended church were
less likely to be involved in delinquency. Frequency of church attendance
was used as a measure of religiosity. Delinquency measures included
larceny, vandalism, assault, and drug use (e.g., alcohol and marijuana use).
Consistent with Hirschi and Stark’s study, they found partial support for
the hypothesis that those who frequently attended church were as likely toEvidence-Based Assessment of Faith-Based Programs 371Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
commit delinquent acts (e.g., larceny, vandalism, and assault). However, the
findings revealed a moderately strong inverse relationship between church
attendance and use of marijuana and alcohol.
Additional studies indicate that religiosity does have a negative impact
on deviant and criminal behavior. Higgins and Albrecht (1977), for example,
examined the relationship between religiosity and delinquency in a random
sample ( n¼1,383) of Atlanta, Georgia tenth graders. They used two items to
measure religiosity (e.g., which church they attend and how often they
attend church or religious services). The outcome measure of delinquent
behavior included 17 items, which ranged from relatively minor offenses
(e.g., skipping school) to more serious offenses (e.g., sold narcotics). The
results indicated a modest to moderately strong negative relationship
between church attendance and each of the 17 delinquent behaviors.
Additional research supports the findings of Higgins and Albrecht (1977) that
church attendance and delinquency are inversely related (see e.g., Albrecht,
Chadwick, & Alcorn, 1977; Burkett, 1977; 1980; Jensen & Erickson, 1979).
In another study, Evans, Cullen, Dunaway, and Burton (1995) assessed
the impact of religiosity on adult criminal behavior using a sample ( n¼477)
of white males from a midwestern, urban area.1They used three multi-item
dimensions of religion to measure religiosity, which included religious
beliefs (hellfire), religious values (salience), and religious activity. They also
included a measure of general religiosity. A 43-item scale was used as a mea-
sure of adult criminal behavior. The authors found that three of the four mea-
sures of religiosity were not statistically significant in reducing adult criminal
behavior. However, religious activities had a direct effect on reducing adult
criminal behavior. This relationship held even with the introduction of secu-
lar controls, and it was not dependent on religious or social contexts.
Johnson, Larson, De Li, and Jang (2000b) examined whether individual
religiosity acted as a protective factor against drug use and other illegal activi-
ties using a sample ( n¼2,358) of inner city black youths from Boston,
Chicago, and Philadelphia. A single-item measure, church attendance, was
used as an indicator of individual religiosity. The outcome measures included
three crime categories: (a) nondrug crime; (b) drug use; and (c) drug selling.
The researchers found individual religiosity was significantly related to a
reduction in offending in all three categories.
Additional research indicates that the relationship between religiosity
and delinquency may be spurious. For example, a study conducted by
Cochran, Wood, and Arneklev (1994) examined a sample ( n¼1,600) of high
school students from Oklahoma to determine whether the relationship
between religiosity and delinquency would remain when controlling for
measures of arousal and social control theories. As noted by Cochran et al.
(1994), the ideal indicators of arousal would be to use both neurological
and extraneurological (i.e., physiological and self-reported) measures.
However, the researchers were unable to use neurological and physiological372 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
indicators and instead settled for self-report data. The arousal scale included
measures of thrill-seeking, impulsivity, and physicality (which were strikingly
similar to self-control measures). Indicators of social control measures of
internalized control (self-esteem and the California Personality Inventory
socialization scale), parental control (parental supervision and broken-home
status), and institutional control (school attachment and commitment) were
included. Three measures of delinquency were examined: interpersonal
delinquency (assault and robbery), property theft (larceny and auto theft)
and property damage (vandalism, arson, and burglary). Religiosity was mea-
sured by two different scales including religious participation (church attend-
ance), and religious salience (importance of church). The findings indicated
when controlling for both arousal and social control indicators, the effect of
religiosity is reduced to insignificance in the case of assault, theft, vandalism,
illicit drug use, and truancy. As a result, the authors concluded that the
relationship between religiosity and delinquency is spurious with regard to
assault, theft, vandalism, illicit drug use, and truancy. Both religious partici-
pation and salience remained significant for legalized substances (e.g.,
tobacco and alcohol).
THE PRESENT STUDY
The purpose of the present study is to conduct an evidence-based assess-
ment of faith-based programs to determine whether they are effective for
reducing recidivism. Others have attempted to assess the effectiveness of
faith-based programs. For example, Johnson et al. (2002) completed a com-
prehensive literature review of the effectiveness of faith-based programs. Our
study goes beyond that of Johnson et al.’s (2002) review because we use an
evidence-based evaluation that is considered the superior method for asses-
sing the effectiveness of programs designed to reduce or prevent criminal
behavior (Sherman, Farrington, Welsh, & MacKenzie, 2002).
METHODS
The Maryland Scientific Methods Scale (SMS) is one of the most widely
accepted tools for assessing scholarly works in criminology. It enables crim-
inologists to critically evaluate the effectiveness of various types of justice-
related programs including those focusing on crime prevention strategies.
The SMS is a 5-point scale that uses specific criteria to assess (or score) the
methodological rigor of studies ranging from Level 1 ( least rigorous ) to Level
5(most rigorous ).
Some of the criteria used to evaluate the quality of a particular study
include the use of pretests and posttests, randomization of the experiments,
the use of comparison and control groups, history, selection bias, causalEvidence-Based Assessment of Faith-Based Programs 373Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
order, evaluation of measurement error, statistical power, research design,
and assessments of internal and external validity (Sherman et al., 2002). If
a study has sufficient methodological rigor (i.e., Level 3 or higher), research-
ers can classify the effectiveness of a program into one of four categories:
‘‘what works, what does not work, what is promising, and what is unknown’’
(Sherman et al., 2002, p. 18).
Programs can be classified as ‘‘working’’ if there are at least two Level 3
to Level 5 evaluation studies that have statistically significant results in the
theoretically expected direction, and the preponderance of empirical evi-
dence suggests programs are effective. Programs may be classified as ‘‘not
working’’ if there are at least two Level 3 to Level 5 evaluations that conclude
the effectiveness of the programs are statistically insignificant, and the pre-
ponderance of the empirical evidence indicates the programs are ineffective.
Those programs that can be coded as ‘‘promising’’ must have at least one
Level 3 to Level 5 evaluation study that has found the effectiveness to be stat-
istically significant, and the preponderance of the empirical evidence sug-
gests that the program is effective. Programs that cannot be classified into
one of the three other categories are defined as having ‘‘unknown’’ effects
(Sherman et al., 2002).
RESEARCH ON FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS
As previously noted, the research on religiosity and delinquency indicates
that individuals who participate in religious organizations are less likely to
participate in deviant and criminal behavior. Thus, it seems plausible that
faith-based programs, which are rooted in religious organizations, may be
effective for reducing criminal offending. Proponents of faith-based initia-
tives argue that religious organizations provide social services more effec-
tively than public agencies (Johnson et al., 2002). To date, there is little
empirical evidence to suggest that faith-based programs are more effective
than their secular counterparts (see for exceptions Clear et al., 2000; Johnson
et al., 2002). In addition, there is a general lack of empirical support for the
claim that faith-based programs are effective in addressing many social ills,
including criminal behavior. It is also important to note that there are a
limited number of studies that have assessed or evaluated the role faith-
based programs have played in the reduction of delinquent and criminal
behavior.
Descriptive Studies
A total of three descriptive studies were identified and included in this evalu-
ation of the effectiveness of faith-based programs to reduce delinquent and =
or criminal behavior (see Table 1). Two of the studies included in this review374 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011

are evaluations of the effectiveness of the Christian-based Teen Challenge’s
drug treatment programs. The first study compared a sample ( n¼not
reported) of graduates (i.e., those who successfully completed the program)
with induction center dropouts (i.e., those who dropped out at the beginning
of the program) and training center dropouts (i.e., those who were unwilling
or unable to complete the program) between 1968 and 1975 (Hess, 1976). A
total of 366 individuals were identified but only 198 (54 %) of those com-
pleted surveys. According to self-report data, individuals who graduated
from the Teen Challenge center showed significant and positive behavioral
changes when compared to the two dropout groups. Specifically, individuals
who graduated from the Teen Challenge program were more likely to
be employed, less likely to have sought additional drug treatment, and
less likely to have criminal records over the 7-year follow-up period (Hess,
1976).
The second study surveyed former Teen Challenge participants who
had successfully completed the four to six month induction program based
in Chattanooga, Tennessee (Thompson, 1994). Graduates of the program
from a 12-year period (1979–1991) were identified ( n¼213) and a random
sample of 50 was subsequently surveyed. Only 50 %of the potential respon-
dents completed surveys ( n¼25). Thompson (1994) concluded the Teen
Challenge graduates have experienced a significant change in both their
behaviors and attitudes with long-term effects. This is a curious finding given
the small sample size and the lack of a control group with which to compare
the Teen Challenge graduates.
Winship and Berrien (1999) investigated whether the Ten Point
Coalition (TPC), based in Boston, Massachusetts, had an impact on the
reduction of youth violence. The TPC, which consisted of churches and local
police departments, joined forces in an effort to reduce youth violence. Prior
to these organizations coming together to address youth crime, according to
one report, the police lacked credibility in the black community (Winship &
Berrien, 1999). When the TPC and police joined forces, many felt that the
TPC helped to create an ‘‘umbrella of legitimacy for the police to work
under’’ (Winship & Berrien, 1999, p. 67). Ministers within the TPC organized
community outreach programs designed to help troubled youth avoid gang
involvement. The ministers also began to report offenders who were
involved in gang or criminal activity to local law enforcement.
As primary evidence that the program ‘‘worked,’’ Winship and Berrien
(1999) noted youth homicide rates between 1990 and 1998 had dropped sig-
nificantly. Specifically, between 1990 and 1998, youth murders dropped from
a high of 152 to a low of 35, which is a 78 %decline. According to the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (1994), national homicide rates were fluctuating (i.e., there
were decreases and increases in youth homicide rates depending on the
year) between 1990 and 1993. After 1994, national homicide rates began
to decline across the United States (BJS, 2001). As a result, it seems more376 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
plausible that the Boston decline in homicide rates is likely attributed to an
overall national decline in homicide rates during this time period.
Multivariate Studies
Two of the four multivariate studies identified evaluated the effectiveness of
separate programs affiliated with the Prison Fellowship Ministries (PFM; see
Table 1). Young, Gartner, O’Connor, Larson, and Wright (1995) used a longi-
tudinal quasi-experimental design to examine whether a faith-based prison
program that trained federal inmates as volunteer prison ministers was effec-
tive in reducing long-term recidivism. The researchers compared inmates
who received the PFM training ( n¼180) with a matched control group
(n¼185) over an eight to 14-year follow-up period. Inmates were fur-
loughed to Washington, DC for an intensive two-week prison ministry sem-
inar, provided by PFM and supported by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
According to Young et al. (1995, p. 101), the purpose of the training ‘‘was
aimed at deepening the prisoners’ Christian faith and preparing them to pro-
vide Christian fellowship and support to their fellow inmates.’’ The PFM
training did not have the explicit purpose of reducing long-term recidivism,
but the researchers wanted to assess whether this was an outcome of the
program.
The overall finding of the chi-square test and survival analysis indicated
that the experimental group had significantly lower rates of recidivism than
the control group, but when disaggregating the analysis some different find-
ings emerged. The PFM training was effective for low-risk offenders, but not
for high-risk offenders. By definition, low-risk offenders would be less likely
to re-offend in the future than high-risk offenders. It seems that the program
worked for individuals who were already at a lowered risk of recidivism. In
addition, the PFM training was not effective in reducing recidivism among
African American males. Contrary to research expectations, African American
males in the PFM group became recidivists at a slightly higher rate than
African American males in the control group. The findings also indicate that
women who participated in the PFM seminar had a drop in recidivism four
times greater than the men. As a result of these findings, one can only con-
clude that the PFM was more effective for certain groups of offenders than
others.
Johnson, Larson, and Pitts (1997) examined the impact of religious pro-
grams on institutional adjustment and recidivism rates in two matched groups
of inmates from four adult New York State prisons. The PFM group ( n¼201)
was compared to a matched control group ( n¼201). Both groups were simi-
lar on measures of institutional adjustment, as measured by both general and
serious disciplinary infractions, and recidivism, as measured by arrest data
during a 1-year follow-up period. The programs offered by the PFM included
in-prison seminars, life plan seminars, and Bible studies. The in-prisonEvidence-Based Assessment of Faith-Based Programs 377Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
seminars and Bible studies were designed to assist inmates in ‘‘their walk
with Christ’’ and to ‘‘provide an ongoing opportunity to study God’s word
and to enjoy Christian fellowship’’ (Johnson et al., 1997, p. 151). The life plan
seminars were designed to help the offender to reintegrate into society and
to enhance their success after release.
The researchers categorized the PFM groups into high, medium, and
low participation classifications. The findings indicate that there was no dif-
ference in the PFM group and the non-PFM group with regard to general
institutional infractions. Although the researchers did not find a significant
difference in the groups, they found the high PFM participants were slightly
less likely than their non-PFM counterparts to commit general institutional
infractions. The findings also show that there was no significant difference
in the PFM and non-PFM groups with regards to serious prison infractions.
After controlling for level of PFM participation, the high PFM group was
slightly more likely than the medium and low categories to commit serious
institutional infractions, which was in the unexpected direction. In examining
the recidivism data, researchers concluded that there was no significant dif-
ference in arrest during the one-year follow-up. After controlling for level of
PFM participation, a different pattern emerged. After the one-year follow-up,
the high PFM participants were significantly less likely than medium or low
PFM participants and their non-PFM counterparts to be rearrested.
Bicknese (1999) conducted a comparative evaluation of the faith-based
Teen Challenge drug treatment program using a one-year follow-up. Those
who had successfully completed Teen Challenge ( n¼59) were compared
to a matched control group ( n¼59), which was composed of clients in
short-term in-patient (STI) programs funded by Medicaid and Medicare.
The groups were similar with regards to demographic and background
(e.g., drug use and prior criminal record) measures. Before and after inter-
views were used to assess the effectiveness of the Teen Challenge program.
The outcome measures included freedom from addictive substances, return
to treatment, employment, and precipitants of drug use such as depression
or cravings. Teen Challenge graduates scored as high or higher compared
to their STI counterparts in all areas of the study. Specifically, the Teen
Challenge group was more likely to remain sober and maintain employment
than the STI group. In addition, fewer Teen Challenge graduates returned to
treatment than in the STI group.
In the final study, Johnson (2002) conducted an exploratory analysis
comparing the recidivism rates for two Brazilian prisons. Braganca prison
was primarily based on a vocational model and the use of prison industry
to better prepare offenders for release and to reduce the cost of operating
the facility. Humaita prison was the first known prison to adopt a completely
faith-based approach to all aspects of prison administration, security, and
programming. The Humaita prisoners ( n¼148) were compared to Braganca
prisoners ( n¼247) on several factors including severity of offense, category378 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
of offense, and time incarcerated. The Humaita prisoners differed signifi-
cantly from the Braganca prisoners on severity of offense; that is, Humaita
prisoners’ offense severity was slightly greater (3.9) than Braganca prisoners’
(3.4). Humaita prisoners were also more likely to have committed more viol-
ent offenses than Braganca prisoners. This means that we would expect the
Humaita prisoners to be at a greater risk for reoffending because of their
more serious criminal histories.
Recidivism rates of the two prison samples were compared over a 3-year
postrelease period from January 1996 through December 1999. The outcome
measure of recidivism included a two-item measure of new arrest and
reincarceration. The findings revealed the recidivism rates for both prisons
were relatively low, Braganca (36 %) and Humaita (16 %). In comparison,
there was a 20-percentage point difference between the recidivism rates of
the two facilities, with Humaita’s rates being lower. Additionally, this finding
held when controlling for high-risk as well as low-risk offenders. These find-
ings indicate that Braganca’s faith-based model has long-term treatment
effects.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of faith-based pro-
grams for reducing recidivism. Proponents of faith-based initiatives often
argue that religious organizations provide social service programs more
effectively than public agencies (Johnson et al., 2002). Unfortunately,
research indicates that there is little empirical evidence that faith-based pro-
grams are more effective than their secular counterparts (Johnson, 2002). In
addition, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of faith-based pro-
grams and their ability to reduce crime. However, Johnson et al. (2002,
p. 21), in a comprehensive literature review of faith-based organizations,
concluded their effectiveness to be ‘‘positive and encouraging’’ although
his he did not conduct an evidence-based assessment. Based on limited
research reviewed here, it appears that faith-based organizations ‘‘work’’ to
reduce recidivism.
All of the studies reviewed here were evaluated using the Maryland
Scientific Methods Scale created by Sherman et al. (2002; see Appendix A).
Three of the studies reviewed were descriptive studies with methodologically
weak research designs (see e.g., Hess, 1976; Thompson, 1994; Winship &
Berrien, 1999). As a result, it is impossible to draw any definitive conclusions
regarding the effectiveness of these faith-based programs and services
(although the researchers of these studies did draw conclusions).
In an effort to rule out rival and =or alternative explanations, experi-
mental designs (i.e., the random assignment of groups) are preferable
(Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). In all of the studies included in thisEvidence-Based Assessment of Faith-Based Programs 379Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
review, researchers were brought in to evaluate programs after the programs
had already been implemented, which means that random assignment was
not an option. But it is important to note that all of the multivariate studies
reviewed for this study were of strong methodological quality. To be more
precise, each of the studies reviewed used quasi-experimental designs
(Bicknese, 1999; Johnson et al., 1997; Young et al., 1995). Two studies were
longitudinal, which can help to establish whether there are long-term treat-
ment effects (Johnson, 2002; Young et al., 1995).
The most serious flaw with the studies reviewed was that researchers
failed to measure religious attachment, which is a key construct that defines
the nature of faith-based programs (see for a similar argument Johnson et al.,
2002). The majority of studies that investigated the relationship between
faith-based programs and crime used ‘‘involvement’’ in church activities or
church attendance as proxy measures of religiosity. From a social control per-
spective, research indicates that involvement in conventional activities is the
least empirically supported proposition of the theory. Yet research on
faith-based programs and their ability to reduce crime indicates that those
who are most involved in church activities or regularly attend church are less
likely to be involved in delinquent and criminal behavior. Researchers argue
that this relationship may be more complex than the research findings suggest.
For example, Benda and Corwyn (1997) claim that it may actually be the attach-
ments that people form with the church or with church members that influence
their subsequent behavior. In other words, those individuals with strong social
attachments would be less likely to participate in deviant behavior.
The limitations notwithstanding, four studies were identified and
reviewed, which had sufficient scientific rigor to draw some preliminary con-
clusions. In evaluating the programs administered and managed by Prison
Fellowship Ministries, the programs appear to work for certain offenders
under certain conditions. Young et al. (1995) found that PFM training was
effective for low-risk offenders but not for high-risk offenders. In addition,
the program did not significantly reduce recidivism among African American
males. The PFM training had its greatest effect with females, who had the
most dramatic reduction in recidivism. It may be that females form strong
attachments within the faith-based programs, which leads to a reduction in
recidivism. Future research should investigate why the program seems to
be more effective for certain offenders.
Johnson et al. (1997) conducted a similar study evaluating the effective-
ness of PFM programs to reduce institutional infractions and recidivism. They
found no significant difference in the PFM and the non-PFM groups with
regard to reduction in institutional infractions. Additionally, while controlling
for level of PFM participation, individuals who reported high levels of partici-
pation were slightly more likely to commit serious institutional infractions,
which is the unexpected direction. However, high PFM participants were
less likely than medium and low PFM participants and their non-PFM380 K. D. Dodson et al.Downloaded by [Kimberly Dodson] at 09:43 22 August 2011 
counterparts to be rearrested. Once again, researchers should investigate
why the program seems to be more effective for certain offenders.
Bicknese (1999) conducted a study of the Teen Challenge program and its
ability to reduce drug use. The Teen Challenge group was more likely to remain
sober, maintain employment, and was less likely to return to treatment than the
comparison group. The findings indicate the Teen Challenge program had at
least short-term effects in reducing substance use. Still a longer follow-up per-
iod would have been preferable to assess the long-term effects of the program.
The final study conducted by Johnson (2002) examined recidivism rates
for two Brazilian prisons. One prison was based on a vocational model and
the other on a faith-based model. The faith-based prison showed lower levels
of recidivism in the 3-year follow-up period. In other words, the faith-based
prison model showed long-term treatment effects. This finding held when
controlling for high-risk as well as low-risk offenders, which is encouraging.
We concluded that faith-based programs reviewed work to reduce
recidivism. These findings should be tempered by the fact that the research
on faith-based programs is limited and much of the research is methodologi-
cally weak. On the other hand, it would be premature to abandon faith-based
programs. Instead, future research should use more rigorous research
designs to determine whether faith-based programs are indeed effective for
reducing criminal behavior.

Abstract This research synthesized results from 66 published and unpublished
evaluations of incarceration-based drug treatment programs using meta-analysis.
Incarceration-based drug treatment prog rams fell into five types: therapeutic
communities (TCs), residential substance abuse treatment (RSAT), group counsel-
ing, boot camps specifically for drug offenders, and narcotic maintenance programs.
We examined the effectiveness of each of these types of interventions in reducing
post-release offending and drug use, and we also examined whether differences in
research findings can be explained by variations in methodology, sample, or program
features. Our results consistently found support for the effectiveness of TC programs
on both outcome measures, and this finding was robust to variations in method,
sample, and program features. We also found support for the effectiveness of RSAT
and group counseling programs in reducing re-offending, but these programs ’effects
on drug use were ambiguous. A limited number of evaluations assessed narcotic
maintenance or boot camp programs; however, the existing evaluations found mixed
support for maintenance programs and no support for boot camps.

programs in reducing recidivism is ambiguous. In the United States of America,
research suggests that between 40% and 45% of inmates are drug dependent. For
example, a 2002 study of US jail inmates found that nearly half (45%) were
substance dependent and another 23% reported substance abuse symptoms (Karberg
and James 2005 ). Similarly, findings from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring
(ADAM) program revealed that the median rate of drug dependence among
incarcerated arrestees in 39 US cities was 39% (Zhang 2003 ). High levels of drug
dependence also have been found in samples from England and Canada. For
example, a study of incarcerated arrestees in five English cities found that 45% of
inmates were drug dependent at one point in their lives and 33% were drug
dependent at the time of interview (Bennett 1998 ). Likewise, a sample of Canadian
federal prisoners found that the rate of drug dependence was between 31% and 43%
(Pernaen et al. 2002 ).
In the absence of effective abuse treatment, it is likely that a high proportion of
these drug-dependent offenders will re-offend. Research consistently indicates that
drug-using probationers/parolees recidivate at higher rates than do non-drug users
(see e.g., Bureau of Justice Statistics 1995 ; Gendreau et al. 1996 ; Horney et al. 1995 ;
MacKenzie et al. 1999 ). Thus, the period of incarceration is a potentially critical
opportunity to intervene in this cycle of drug use and crime. However, the two most
common types of drug abuse interventions in US prisons and jails, self-help 12-step
and drug education programs, have not been demonstrated to reduce recidivism, in
existing reviews of the literature (Pearson and Lipton 1999 ; Lipton et al. 1992 ).
In recognition of the potential of incar ceration-based drug treatment, the
limitations of existing programs, and the rising need for effective substance abuse
interventions, US Congress created the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment
(RSAT) Program under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994 [Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) 2005 ]. This program provides financial
assistance to local and state correctional facilities to develop and implement
incarceration-based drug treatment programs. Between fiscal years 1996 and 2003,
more than $400 million have been provided to the states under this program; and as
of July 2004, 300 RSAT programs were in operation (BJA 2005 ).
This tremendous investment in incarceration-based drug treatment programs and
their proliferation present a host of important questions that need to be addressed,
such as: Are incarceration-based drug treatment programs effective in reducing
recidivism? Does the existing body of research indicate that participation in RSAT-
funded programs reduces recidivism? Are there particular types of drug treatment
that are especially effective or ineffective? Approximately how effective are these
programs? What characteristics differentiate effective programs from ineffective
programs? This research attempts to answer these questions by synthesizing existing
evaluations of incarceration-based drug treatment programs using systematic,
quantitative review techniques.
Common incarceration-based drug treatment programs and their effectiveness
Many correctional interventions could be interpreted as “incarceration-based drug
treatment. ”We defined incarceration-based drug treatment programs as interventions354 O. Mitchell, et al.
that were specifically targeted at substance abusers, intended to reduce future
substance abuse and other criminal behaviors, and were based in a prison, jail, or
analogous facility for juvenile offenders. Given this definition, program evaluations
fell into five types: (1) therapeutic community (TC) programs, (2) RSAT-funded
programs (most of which were based on the TC model), (3) group counseling
programs, (4) boot camps for drug offenders, and (5) narcotic maintenance
programs.
TCs are the most intensive of all incarceration-based drug treatment programs.
While the components of TCs vary, there are several common components. TCs
house participants in a distinct treatment unit away from the anti-social influences of
the general correctional environment to create an atmosphere focused on
rehabilitation and reformation. Another core component of the TC model is that
participants are instrumentally involved in running the TC; for example, participants
lead treatment sessions, monitor other residents for rule compliance, maintain the
treatment unit, and resolve disputes. TCs have a confrontational nature in which both
staff and participants openly challenge anti-social behaviors and attitudes; yet,
participants also are supportive of each others ’struggles to make pro-social
reformations. Many TCs share a philosophy that sees drug abuse as symptomatic
of a broader personality disorder, and, consequently, many TCs focus on the larger
disorder and not just drug abuse, per se (Kooyman 1993 ). Further, not only are TCs
intense in nature but they are also long in duration —typically lasting at least 6
months but usually around 12 months.
RSAT-funded programs share several components with the TC model. Like TC
programs, RSAT-funded programs usually separate program participants from the
general population; they tend to be intensive and have a long duration (6 to 12
months for prison-based programs, or at least 3 months for jail-based programs).
Within these parameters, local corrections agencies control the content of such
programs. Our review of the extant literature reveals that most of the RSAT-funded
programs are based on the TC model. Thus, in this review, RSAT-funded programs
are essentially TCs, but not all TCs are RSAT-funded programs.
Counseling programs use various combinations of drug education, self-help 12-
step programming, life skills training, and cognitive and behavioral skills training.
The key commonality among these programs is their reliance on group-based
counseling approaches, in which substance abuse and other common problems are
discussed among peers in an effort to solve these problems. Typically, counseling
programs are multi-faceted, including several of the above-mentioned components;
however, some counseling programs heavily emphasize one of these components.
And still other counseling programs include both group and individual counseling.
Boot camps are modeled after military basic training. Inmates participate in
rigorous exercise regimens, learn military drill and ceremony, wear uniforms, and
take on challenge courses (timed obstacle courses). Boot camps are highly
structured. From the moment residents wake in the morning until lights out they
are constantly engaged in scheduled activities. Boots camps also involve
considerable confrontation, but, unlike TC programs, confrontations most often
occur between correctional staff and inmates —with drill instructors disciplining any
deviation from established codes of conduct. Boot camp proponents claim that the
harsh nature of boot camps serves as a deterrent to future criminal conduct, and theIncarceration-based drug treatment 355
content of these programs instills self-discipline, which also leads to reduced
recidivism (Wilson and MacKenzie, 2006 ).
Narcotic maintenance programs [i.e., methadone and levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol
(LAAM) maintenance] are pharmacological approaches. These programs attempt to
reduce the harms associated with opiate dependency (e.g., disease transmission,
criminal activity) by prescribing synthetic opioid medication. Unlike heroin and
other strong opiates, these medications do not produce a euphoric high; instead,
methadone and LAAM block the euphoric high produced by opiate use and suppress
opiate withdrawal symptoms. Incarceration-based narcotic maintenance programs
link released inmates to community-based programs for continued care. The success
of incarceration-based maintenance programs appears to be heavily dependent on
their ability to place released offenders into community-based programs.
Each of the above types of drug interventions has the potential to reduce drug use
and other criminal behaviors. However, existing systematic reviews of this body of
research have found that only participation in TC programs was consistently
associated with reductions in recidivism. In particular, Pearson and Lipton ( 1999 )
systematically reviewed experimental and quasi-experimental research assessing the
effectiveness of corrections-based drug abuse programs in reducing recidivism
conducted in any country and completed between 1968 and 1996, inclusive. Their
search revealed 30 studies meeting their eligibility criteria. These authors found that
six of the seven TC evaluations indicated that participants exhibited lower recidivism
than non-participants; the overall mean weighted reffect size was 0.133 ( p=0.025).
By contrast, the mean effect size was not statistically significant and near zero for
both boot camp and group counseling programs. Although Pearson and Lipton ’s
review found too few studies of methadone maintenance, drug education, cognitive-
behavioral, and 12-step programs to draw strong conclusions, it characterized the
existing evidence of these programs ’effectiveness as being promising.
In many regards, this systematic review is an extension of the work by Pearson
and Lipton. Like that earlier work, this synthesis systematically and comprehen-
sively reviews the effects of incarceration-based drug interventions on post-treatment
drug use and other types of criminal behaviors, using meta-analytic procedures. The
primary difference between their work and the current systematic review is that this
research project uses a more current time frame (1980 through 2004). We believe
that this difference is salient for two reasons: (1) more recent evaluations of drug
treatment interventions may be more generalizable to current correctional practices;
and, (2) numerous evaluations of incarceration-based drug treatment programs have
been conducted since 1996, particularly evaluations of RSAT programs.
Method
Eligibility criteria
The scope of this review was published or unpublished experimental and quasi-
experimental evaluations of incarceration-based drug treatment programs for juveniles
and adults that utilized a comparison group. The eligibility criteria for this review were
that: (1) the evaluation assessed an intervention that was administered in a correctional356 O. Mitchell, et al.
facility; (2) the intervention specifically targeted substance users; (3) the evaluation
used an experimental or two-group quasi-experimental research design that included a
no-treatment or minimal treatment comparison group; (4) the evaluation reported a
post-release outcome measuring offending or drug use; (5) the intervention was
conducted between 1980 and 2004, inclusive; and, (6) the evaluation had to report
enough information for us to calculate an effect size.
Regarding the first eligibility criterion, our operational definition of “correctional
facilities ”included only jails and prisons, and analogous facilities for juveniles.
Interventions conducted at half-way houses or community-based residential facilities
were not included. It is worth noting that this criterion excluded a small number of
notable evaluations. Specifically, programs designed to be alternatives to incarcer-
ation, such as those reported in Dynia and Sung ( 2000 ) and Knight and Hiller
(1997 ), were excluded by this criterion.
The second criterion restricted the focus of this review to evaluations that
specifically targeted drug users. Therapeutic interventions conducted in correctional
facilities that were generally available to offenders regardless of an offender ’s drug
history were not included. For instance, Shaw and MacKenzie ( 1992 ) evaluated the
effects of a boot camp program on a sub-sample of drug-using offenders; however,
this evaluation was excluded because the boot camp program was not specifically
targeted at drug users. By contrast, Zhang ( 2000 ) evaluated a boot camp program
specifically geared towards drug users —this evaluation was included in this review.
This criterion was necessary, because this review is concerned with incarceration-
based drug treatment ; without this criterion, the present review would become a
review of incarcerated-based treatment comprised of drug users.
The third criterion specified that all included evaluations must have a comparison/
control group that received no treatment or minimal treatment. Thus, we excluded
quasi-experiments that involved comparisons of two or more interventions that were
roughly comparable or whose comparability in terms of effectiveness in reducing
recidivism was in dispute (i.e., treatment –treatment comparisons or dose –response
evaluations). For example, the comparison group in the study by Swartz et al. ( 1996 )
was constructed by dividing program participants into four groups based upon length
of program participation. Evaluations utilizing such comparison groups were not
included in this systematic review. Furthermore, we did not include evaluations in
which the comparison group was comprised predominantly or solely of dropouts
from the intervention of interest. For instance, evaluations such as those by Field
(1985 ,1989 ) and Berggren and Svard ( 1990 ) that used program drop-outs as the
comparison group were excluded from this systematic review.
The fourth and fifth criteria are largely self-explanatory. We chose to exclude
studies conducted before 1980, because we questioned the generalizability of
findings from such studies to current correctional contexts. It is important to
emphasize, however, that all evaluations needed to report a post-release measure of
recidivism. This criterion excluded a few notable evaluations, such as those by
Shewan et al. ( 1996 ) and Dolan et al. ( 2003 ), which reported in-prison outcomes.
The last criterion excluded evaluations that did not report enough information for
us to calculate an effect size. This criterion was necessary for practical purposes.
Unfortunately, a handful of otherwise eligible evaluations (e.g., those by Schippers
et al. 1998 ; Guerin 2002 ) were ruled ineligible on the basis of this last criterion.Incarceration-based drug treatment 357
Search strategy
The goal of the search strategy was to identify all studies, published or unpublished,
that met the above eligibility criteria. The search began by our conducting a
computerized keyword search of bibliographic databases. In particular, we
conducted a search of the following databases: PsychLit, MedLine, NCJRS,
Criminal Justice Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social
Science Citation Index, SocioFile, Conference Papers Index, UnCover, C2 SPECTR,
and CINAHL, as well as Google internet searches. The keywords used were: drug
treatment, substance abuse treatment, drug counseling, therapeutic community(ies),
methadone maintenance, boot camp(s), offenders, residential substance abuse
treatment, RSAT, inmates, incarceration, incarcerated, prison, evaluation, outcome
evaluation, and recidivism. These keywords were used in various combinations.
We also searched for eligible evaluations by carefully reading existing reviews of
unfamiliar research. In particular, we reviewed the reference lists of existing
syntheses to identify potentially eligible evaluations. Likewise, many of the eligible
studies reviewed the work of similar studies; these studies were also assessed for
eligibility. Additionally, we reviewed the Digest of Research on Drug Use and HIV/
AIDS in Prisons (Flanagan et al. 2004 ), which abstracts much of the “grey”
literature, particularly European grey research.
Further, we searched websites of several prominent research organizations.
Specifically, we searched for relevant research reports on the following websites:
Correctional Service Canada ’s research publications page; the Home Office; RAND
Drug Policy Research Center; The Urban Institute ’s crime/justice research page; and,
Vera Institute of Justice ’s publications page.
Finally, we hand-searched the titles/abstracts of articles published between 1999
and 2004 in the following journals: Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment ,
International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology ,Journal
of Drug Issues ,The Prison Journal ,Crime & Delinquency , and Journal of Offender
Rehabilitation . We chose to hand-search these journals because they have a strong
track record of publishing relevant studies, and many of these journals were not
indexed well by the computerized databases we utilized.
All studies that could not be ruled ineligible, based on a preliminary review of the
title and abstract, were retrieved. That is, we reviewed each title/abstract looking for
clear evidence that the study violated one or more of the eligibility criteria. For
example, the first eligibility criterion was that all studies evaluated an intervention
administered in a correctional facility; thus, if a title/abstract clearly indicated that
the study assessed a program that was not administered in a correctional facility, then
the study was not retrieved for further scrutiny. We read closely the retrieved studies
to determine final eligibility status.
It is important to note that the unit of analysis in this meta-analysis is the
evaluation —a contrast between one treatment group and one comparison group. We
distinguish studies , documents reporting the results of an evaluation or evaluations,
from evaluations , specific contrasts between a treatment and comparison group. This
distinction is necessary, as several studies reported the results of more than one
evaluation; that is, evaluations were nested within studies.358 O. Mitchell, et al.
Coding of effect sizes and moderator variables
The coding forms employed in this review were structured hierarchically, so that we
could recognize explicitly the nested nature of evaluations within studies. Any
number of effect sizes could be coded from each evaluation using these forms.
Further, the coding forms captured key features of the nature of the treatment,
research sample, research methodology, outcome measures, and direction and
magnitude of observed effects.
We coded at least one effect size from each evaluation. We utilized the odds ratio
effect size for dichotomous outcomes, as this type of effect size is the most appropriate
for such outcomes (Lipsey and Wilson 2001 ). Indicators of criminal behavior based on
non-dichotomous scales were coded using the standardized mean difference effect
size. Effect sizes were coded in a manner such that positive effect sizes indicated that
the treatment group had a more favorable outcome than the comparison group did
(i.e., less re-offending or drug use). Odds ratio and standardized mean difference
effect sizes were combined using the method developed by Hasselblad and Hedges
(1995 ). Specifically, mean difference effect sizes were transformed onto the odds ratio
effect size scale (see also Sánchez-Meca et al. 2003 ).
It is important to note that many authors in this body of research report their
findings by contrasting participants who completed the treatment ( “graduates ”),
participants who failed to complete the treatment ( “failures ”), and the comparison
group. Findings reported in this manner clearly open the door for selection bias, and,
thus, such findings are difficult to interpret (i.e., was the observed reduction in
recidivism due to the treatment or selection bias). Whenever we encountered results
reported in this fashion, we re-calculated recidivism rates for the treatment group by
combining graduates with failures. We then compared this overall treatment group to
the comparison group. We believed that this practice would reduce the likelihood
that selection bias would influence the results of this meta-analysis.
Our analyses of these effect sizes utilized the statistical approach outlined by
Lipsey and Wilson ( 2001 ) and Cooper and Hedges ( 1994 ). In particular, we used the
inverse variance method and assumed that the true treatment effects varied as a
function of both measured (i.e., coded features of each evaluation) and unmeasured
differences between evaluations. This analytic approach required statistical inde-
pendence of effect sizes. Several types of statistical dependencies were evident in the
coded evaluations. First, it was common for evaluators to measure and analyze more
than one indicator of criminal behavior (e.g., re-arrest, re-conviction, drug use) or
analyze the same indicator of criminal behavior at multiple post-program follow-ups
(e.g., 6 months, 12 months). Second, it was also common for authors to report
findings from the same sample of research participants in multiple studies.
We employed several procedures to attain statistical independence. As a first-step,
all evaluations were cross-checked against one another to ensure that each evaluation
was included no more than once in each data set. Next, we created two data sets, one for
drug use outcomes and another for re-offending outcomes. Some evaluations reported
more than one measure of drug use or re-offending:, instead of simply averaging these
multiple measures, we selected particular outcomes of interest to maximize com-
parability of outcomes. In particular, for re-offending measures, we selected effect sizesIncarceration-based drug treatment 359
that were: (1) general (i.e., covered all offense types as opposed to being offense
specific), (2) based on re-arrests, (3) dichotomous, and (4) followed sample members
for 12 months. We decided to select such effect sizes because this type of outcome
measure was the most commonly reported outcome measure. For evaluations that did
not report such an outcome, we coded the available outcome that most closely
resembled this preferred outcome measure. Thus, the re-offending data set primarily
contained outcome measures concerning re-arrest rates in the first 12-months after
release. Similarly, for the drug use data set, we selected effect sizes that were:
(1) general (i.e., concerning any illicit drug use), (2) dichotomous, and, (3) followed
sample members for 12 months. Consequently, the drug relapse data set primarily
contained outcomes concerning drug relapse in the first 12 months after release.
Results
Description of eligible studies and evaluations
Our search strategy uncovered 233 potentially eligible studies. We were able to obtain
copies of 229 of these studies. Of the retrieved studies, 53 unique studies met our
eligibility criteria. These 53 unique studies reported the results of 66 independent
evaluations, as several studies contained multiple evaluations. Of these evaluations, 58
had been conducted in the United States of America, three had been conducted in
Australia, three had been conducted in Canada, one had been conducted in the UK, and
one evaluation had been conducted in Taiwan. Approximately half of the evaluations
(32) were coded from studies published as journal articles or book chapters, and the
other 34 evaluations were coded from unpublished technical reports and government
documents. In regards to date of publication, two-thirds of the evaluations were coded
from studies made available after 1996 —the latest date eligible for inclusion in Pearson
and Lipton ’s(1999 ) review; thus, the vast majority of the evaluations included in the
current research were not included in the earlier review.
The bulk of the evaluations assessed either TC or counseling programs. of the 66
evaluations, 30 examined the effectiveness of TC programs, and another 25
evaluations were of counseling programs. Relatively few of the evaluations were
of narcotic maintenance programs or boot camp programs designed for drug
offenders: five and two evaluations, respectively. And primary type of treatment
modality could not be reliably coded for four evaluations.
Mean odds ratio for re-offending and drug use outcomes
Of the 66 evaluations, 65 reported at least one re-offending outcome measure. One
odds ratio was an outlier in the negative direction; this odds ratio was “Winsorized ”
to the 5th percentile.1Approximately 83% of the 65 odds ratios for offending
1The outlier came from an evaluation of a narcotics maintenance program (Magura et al. 1993 , female
sample). The logged odds ratio for this contrast was -4.61, indicating that the comparison group had a
lower rate of post-release offending than the treatment group did. No other logged odds ratio had an
absolute value of 2 or more. Alternative analyses that excluded this outlier yielded substantively similar
results.360 O. Mitchell, et al.
indicated that the treatment group re-offended less than the comparison group did.
The random-effects mean odds ratio was 1.37, with a 95% confidence interval (CI)
of 1.24 to 1.51. This finding indicates that, in general, participation in incarceration-
based drug treatment programs was associated with a reduction in post-release
offending. A more intuitive sense of this effect size can be gained by translating this
effect size into percentages. As a matter of convenience, we assumed a 50% rate of
re-offending for the comparison group. Given this assumption, the overall means
odds ratio translates into a 42% re-offending rate for the treatment group.2The
distribution of the odds ratios for offending exhibited considerably more variability
than expected by sampling error alone ( Q=551.84, df=64, p<0.001). This finding
suggested that features of the treatment programs, research methodology, and/or
characteristics of the sample might be systematically related to effect size.
Subsequent analyses tested this possibility.
Examination of the effect for drug use produced a slightly smaller overall mean
effect size that was not statistically significant. The random-effects mean odds ratio
for the 20 evaluations on drug use outcomes was 1.28 (95% CI of 0.92-1.78), and
there was more variability than expected by sampling error alone ( Q=197.97 df=19,
p<0.001). Thus, with respect to drug relapse, the evidence suggests great variability
in effects across evaluations, and, overall, we cannot conclude that these programs
are effective in reducing post-release drug use, although the evidence is positive.
Moreover, the finding of great variability in effects suggests that there may be
program or method features that are associated with drug relapse effects; for
example, perhaps participation in programs with long treatment durations do, in fact,
facilitate post-release reductions in drug use.
Moderator analyses
The above analyses indicated that the effect size distributions displayed more
variability than expected by chance alone. This finding suggested that there may be
important differences in research methodology, sample, and/or interventions that
may account for some of this variability in effect size. We tried to capture important
differences between evaluations by coding information from each evaluation. These
moderator analyses, however, were confronted with three major issues. First, our
ability to code many relevant features was limited by the quality of the descriptions
provided by the primary authors. Second, the moderator analyses had limited
statistical power. Post-hoc power analyses revealed that the power to detect a small
effect (i.e., a difference in logged odds ratio of 0.20) in these moderator analyses
ranged from approximately 0.10 to 0.40. This limited statistical power means that
only contrasts with large effects were likely to be statistically significant. To combat
this issue, we interpreted as statistically significant any contrast th at had a
probability of occurring by chance alone of less than 10% (i.e., p<0.10), and,
instead of relying solely on statistical significance , we discussed substantively
significant effects. We defined “substantively significant ”relationships based on the
2Alternatively, we assumed a 35% re-offending rate for the comparison group, which was the average 12-
month re-offending rate. This effect size suggested a 28% rate of re-offending for the treatment group.Incarceration-based drug treatment 361
magnitude of the difference between categories in terms of the logged odds ratio.
Specifically, if a moderator variable ’s categories differed by a logged odds ratio of
0.20 or more, and each category had a least five evaluations, then we considered
such differences as substantively significant. Similarly, if one category of a
moderator had fewer than five evaluations, and the difference between categories
was 0.40 or more, then we considered such differences as substantively significant.
Third, all of the moderator analyses were essentially bivariate. Unfortunately, the
limited number of available effect sizes, and the sparseness of the data sets utilized,
made multivariate data analysis highly problematic, and the results of such analyses
were very sensitive to small alternations (e.g., excluding one observation). As a
result, these bivariate findings were vulnerable to spuriousness. Given these
challenges, the following moderator analyses are offered as suggestive.
The first moderator variable examined was primary type of intervention. Table 1
displays the random-effects mean odds ratio effect size for each type of treatment
program for re-offending and drug use outcomes. Analysis of these means indicated
that treatment effectiveness on both types of outcome measures varied considerably
by primary type of intervention (re-offending: Q=6.36 with df=3,p=0.09. This
analysis excludes the “ambiguous ”category, drug use: Q=4.29 with df=2,p=0.12).
The mean odds ratio for TC programs on re-offending outcomes was 1.38, with a
95% CI of 1.17 to 1.62. As this CI did not include 1.00, this mean odds ratio is
statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Similarly, the mean odds ratio for the 12
evaluations of TC programs on drug use outcomes was 1.41 (95% CI 0.95-2.05, p<
0.10). These findings indicated that TC participants generally had statistically lower
rates of re-offending and drug use after release from incarceration than did non-
participants.
Ten of the TC evaluations were RSAT-funded programs (not shown in Table 1).
These ten evaluations yielded a mean odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.10 –1.76) for the
re-offending outcomes. Only four of the ten RSAT evaluations assessed a drug use
outcome; two of these evaluations indicated that participants in RSAT-funded
programs had lower drug use rates than non-participants, and the other two
evaluations found just the opposite. Not surprisingly, given these conflicting results,
the overall mean odds ratio from these four evaluations was 1.02 (95% CI 0.48 –
2.15), which indicates no difference. Thus, the existing evidence indicated that
RSAT-funded programs were associated with statistically significant reductions in re-

offending, but the limited available evidence was decidedly mixed in regards to drug
use outcomes.
Likewise, evaluations of counseling programs indicated that these programs were
associated with statistically significant reductions in re-offending but that these
programs ’effects on drug use were ambiguous. In particular, the 25 evaluations of
counseling programs exhibited the largest mean odds ratio on re-offending outcomes
(1.50, 95% CI 1.25 –1.79). Once again, the available evidence is scant in regards to
drug use, with only three evaluations reporting drug use outcomes. Two of the three
effect sizes were greater than, 1 indicating that program participants had less post-
release drug use; however, one effect size was substantially less than 1. Combined,
these three odds ratios yielded a mean odds ratio of 0.77 (95% CI 0.35 –1.67).
A particularly small number of evaluations assessed the effectiveness of
incarceration-based narcotic maintenance or boot camp programs for drug offenders.
The handful of extant evaluations of narcotic maintenance programs indicated that
participation in maintenance programs was associated with substantially significant
reductions in drug use but not re-offending. All four of the odds ratios for drug use
outcomes indicated that participation in narcotic maintenance programs produced
lower post-release drug use than not-participating; this random-effect mean is
substantively large, 1.94, but it was not statistically significant ( p=0.11). By
contrast, three of the four odds ratios for offending indicated that participants were
more likely to re-offend than were non-participants. The two available evaluations of
boot camps indicated that these programs were not associated with statistically
significant reductions in either re-offending or drug use. Both of the evaluations
measuring re-offending outcomes found that boot camp participants had slightly
lower rates of re-offending than non-participants did (i.e., both evaluations had
logged odds ratios less than 0.14).
As further evidence of the importance of primary type of treatment, we found that
the association between odds ratio and several moderator variables depended on
whether the odds ratio came from the evaluation of a TC or of a counseling program.
Therefore, we conducted separate moderator analyses for TC and counseling
programs in a series of parallel analyses. The odds ratios concerning boot camp,
narcotic maintenance, and ambiguous programs were set aside for these analyses.
Table 2examines variation in the odds ratios for offending by coded
methodological features. One of the most important findings from Table 2is that
the vast majority of the mean odds ratios were statistically significant, which
suggests that the finding that TC participants had lower rates of re-offending than did
non-participants was largely robust to methodological variations. The first moderator
variable, “overall method quality, ”was a four-point ordinal measure of the internal
validity of each evaluation. This four-point categorization was similar to the
University of Maryland ’s Scientific Methods Scale (see Farrington et al. 2006 ). The
lowest level of method quality was “weak quasi-experimental designs. ”These
studies utilized a comparison that lacked comparability to the treatment group before
the intervention. The next level of method quality, “standard quasi-experiment, ”was
assigned to evaluations characterized by research designs that used a comparison
group that was slightly different from the treatment group on important observed
variables before the intervention. “Rigorous quasi-experiments ”were characterized
as evaluations involving treatment and comparison groups that were highlyIncarceration-based drug treatment 363
comparable in important observed variables (e.g., age, gender, prior criminal history,
prior drug use) or as evaluations that employed slightly different treatment and
comparison groups but also used multivariate analyses that controlled for pre-
existing differences in important variables. The highest level of method quality,
“experimental designs, ”randomly assigned research participants to conditions and
did not have attrition problems.3
Most of the available evaluations were methodologically weak. Of the 30 TC
evaluations, 63% were rated as weak quasi-experiments (20%) or as standard quasi-
experiments (43%). Nine evaluations (30%) were rated as rigorous quasi-experiments,
and two (7%) were rated as experimental designs. Thus, in absolute terms, this body of
research was rated as methodologically weak; yet, in relative terms, these evaluations
were comparable in methodological rigor to other criminal justice research. In
particular, Weisburd et al. ( 2001 ) rated the methodological rigor of a sample of 308
evaluations of criminal justice interventions using a scale very similar to the one used
in our research. Those authors reported that 73% of evaluations were either weak
(level 2) or standard (level 3) quasi-experiments and that 24% were either rigorousTable 2 Odds ratio for offending, by methodological features: therapeutic communities

3We coded two types of attrition problems: total and differential. Total attrition problems were defined as
overall attrition of 20% or greater, or if the primary authors indicated that attriters differed substantially
from non-attriters. Differential attrition problems were defined similarly; that is, differential attrition of
20% or greater, or if the primary authors indicated that attrition substantially reduced the comparability of
the treatment and comparison group.364 O. Mitchell, et al.
quasi-experiments (level 4) or randomized experiments (level 5); in comparison, the
corresponding percentages for our research were 63% and 37%.
A common concern when one is dealing with a body of research that is generally
methodologically weak is that this research may systematically overestimate
treatment effects. In other words, perhaps methodologically weak evaluations are
more likely to find treatment effects than are more rigorous evaluations. The research
of Weisburd et al. ( 2001 ) research found precisely this pattern of results. Our
synthesis of TC evaluations, however, reveals a different pattern of results. Table 2
indicates that the mean odds ratios for the three highest levels of method quality
were all statistically significant, indicating that the effectiveness of TC programs was
not confined to only methodologically weak evaluations. Further, the methodolog-
ical quality variable was statistically associated with effect size; all of the three
higher levels of rigor had mean effect sizes that were statistically larger than the
lowest level of rigor, and evaluations with the highest level of rigor differed
statistically from the three lower levels. Thus, evaluations with the highest level of
rigor produced the largest treatment effects.
Two additional methodological factors, type of comparison group and publication
status, had a statistically significant relationship to effect size. Evaluations that
formed the comparison group via random assignment had the largest odds ratios,
whereas, evaluations that utilized individuals who declined to participate in TC
treatment had the lowest odds ratios. Post-hoc analyses indicated that evaluations
composed of decliners had statistically smaller odds ratios than did the other
comparison groups, and evaluations that utilized comparison groups formed by
randomization had a larger mean odds ratio than did either evaluations that utilized a
comparison group of decliners, or offenders from other jurisdictions/facilities. This
set of findings, once again, suggests that evidence of the effectiveness of TC
programs is not confined to methodologically suspect evaluations (i.e., evaluations
that utilized comparison group composed of decliners or offenders from other
jurisdictions/facilities or time periods).
Another methodological characteristic that had a statistically significant associ-
ation with effect size was publication status. Specifically, evaluations coded from
published studies exhibited statistically larger effect sizes than evaluations from
unpublished studies. This finding is an indication of publication bias in evaluations
of TC programs. As a further test for the presence of publication bias in these
evaluations, we conducted specialized st atistical tests for publication bias.
Specifically, we conducted both the Begg and Mazumdar ( 1994 ) and the Egger et
al. (1997 ) tests for publication bias. The more statistically powerful Egger et al.
method found evidence of publication bias. Given this finding, we conducted Duvall
and Tweedie ’s(2000 )“trim and fill ”method for accounting for publication bias.
This procedure added seven effect sizes to the distribution, which lowered the mean
random effects odds ratio to 1.21, with a 95% CI of 1.08 to 1.36 ( Q=252.90, df=36,
p<0.001); this publication bias-adjusted mean odds ratio translates into a re-
offending rate of approximately 45% for the treatment group, if we continue to make
the convenient assumption that 50% of the comparison group re-offends.
Table 3presents the results of a similar bivariate analysis between the odds ratios
for re-offending and sample/treatment characteristics for the odds ratio from
evaluations of TC programs. Three sample characteristic were coded: age groupIncarceration-based drug treatment 365
(juvenile or adult), gender composition of sample, and type of offender (non-violent
or a mixture of violent and non-violent offenders). Five treatment characteristics
were coded: the presence of a mandatory aftercare component, treatment location
(prison or jail), length of treatment (more than 90 days or fewer than 90 days), nature
of participation (strictly voluntary vs at least some non-voluntary participation), and
program maturity. These analyses found that none of the coded sample or treatment
characteristics displayed a statistically or substantively significant relationship with
effect size. Perhaps the most striking finding from Table 3is that nearly all of the
mean odds ratios were statistically significant, which suggests that evidence of the
effectiveness of TC programs is largely robust to sample and program variations.
Stated differently, participation in TC programs were associated with lower rates of
re-offending, regardless of the age group, gender composition, offender type, use of
coercion to compel participation, and several other factors.
A parallel set of analyses was conducted for counseling programs (Tables 4and5).
Once more, most evaluations were methodologically weak. Nearly three-quarters
(72%) of evaluations were rated as either “weak ”or“standard ”quasi-experiments,
which again is fairly typical of criminal justice research, as revealed by Weisburd etTable 3 Odds ratios for offending, by sample/treatment features: therapeutic communities

al. (2001 ). This lack of methodological rigor was particularly problematic, as
evaluations rated higher on this scale exhibited non-statistically significant mean
odds ratios. In particular, evaluations rated as “rigorous ”quasi-experiments or
“experimental designs ”exhibited mean effect sizes of 1.33 (95% CI 0.86 –2.06) and
1.09 (95% CI 0.52 –2.30), respectively, neither of which was statistically significant.
While the statistical test comparing the mean odds ratios for the various levels of
methodological rigor was not statistically significant, substantively, this finding
suggests that the strongest evidence of the effectiveness of counseling programs in
reducing re-offending came from methodologically weak evaluations —a finding that
parallels that of Weisburd et al. ( 2001 ). The only methodological variable that had a
statistically significant association with the magnitude of the odds ratios was
differential attrition. Evaluations that had more than 20% differential overall attrition
had a mean odds ratio that was statistically less than those without differential
attrition problems.
The moderator distinguishing published from unpublished studies found no
difference in the magnitude of the effect for counseling programs. This finding
comports with specialized tests for publication bias (i.e., the Begg and Mazumdar,
and Egger et al. publication bias tests). These findings converged in concluding that
there was no evidence of publication bias among evaluations of counseling
programs.

statistically larger mean odds ratio than evaluations that used samples of juvenile.
The gender composition moderator was also statistically related to odds ratio. In
particular, evaluations that were composed solely of female offenders had a larger
mean odds ratio than evaluations of samples of men or of mixed genders; in fact,
post-hoc contrasts indicated that all three mean odds ratios statistically differed from
one another.
In addition to the moderator variables coded from evaluations of TC programs,
for the evaluations of counseling programs we also coded primary emphasis of each
program. Unfortunately, many evaluations were not described in detail by the
primary authors, and, as a consequence, our ability to code program variation was
limited. We were able to categorize 17 of the 25 programs evaluated into three types:
cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step programming/drug education, and multifaceted
(i.e., programs that combined the above approaches without a clearly discernibleTable 5 Odds-ratios for offending, by sample and treatment features: counseling programs

primary emphasis); the remaining eig ht evaluations did not supply enough
information to be reliably classified and are listed as “Unknown emphasis ”in Table 5.
The evaluations classified into the unknown emphasis category exhibited the largest
mean odds ratio (2.14, with 95% CI of 1.54 –2.97), whereas, evaluations of
multifaceted programs yielded the smallest mean odds ratio (1.21, with 95% CI of
0.85–1.72). Post-hoc contrasts indicated that the evaluations in the unknown
emphasis category had statistically larger mean odds ratio than did either evaluations
of cognitive behavioral therapy or multifaceted counseling; none of the other
categories differed statistically from one another. Thus, the strongest evidence of the
effectiveness of counseling programs comes from evaluations without a clear
depiction of the treatment provided to program participants. Interestingly, the
evidence suggests that the most popular incarceration-based drug treatment modality,
12-step/drug education, exhibited a substantively and statistically significant mean
odds ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.00 –2.36).
One other treatment characteristic was related to odds ratio. Evaluations of
programs that were strictly voluntary had a statistically larger mean odds ratio than
did other evaluations of counseling programs. In fact, evaluations in which at least
some program participants did not volunteer for treatment produced a mean odds
ratio (1.07) that did not differ statistically or substantively from 1.00, which suggests
that in such evaluations program participants and non-participants had similar rates
of re-offending.
Discussion
In concordance with the authors of existing reviews (e.g., Wilson et al. 2005 ;
Pearson and Lipton 1999 ), we found no evidence that participation in boot camp
programs reduced post-release offending or drug use. While the number of existing
evaluations of boot camp programs for drug offenders was very small, given the
consistency of our findings to other research on boot camps, it appears unlikely that
boot camp programs generally reduce recidivism.
The evidence concerning the effectiveness of narcotic maintenance programs was
mixed. We found no evidence of the effectiveness of such programs in reducing re-
offending; in fact, program participants had somewhat higher re-offending rates than
non-participants in four out of the five evaluations. By contrast, all existing
evaluations found somewhat lower rates of post-release drug use among participants
than non-participants, and the random-effects mean odds ratio for these four
evaluations was substantively large (1.95). Thus, incarceration-based narcoti c
maintenance programs may reduce drug use, but the scant existing evidence does
not indicate that such program reduce re-offending. Our ability to draw firm
conclusions in this area of research, however, is undermined by the limited statistical
power of our analyses. Continued research investigating the effectiveness of these
programs would be a significant contribution to the knowledge base.
The most consistent evidence of treatment effectiveness came from evaluations of
TC programs. These programs consistently showed post-release reductions in re-
offending and drug relapse. This finding was robust to methodological variation. In
fact, even among the most rigorous evaluations, participation in TC programs wasIncarceration-based drug treatment 369
consistently related to reductions in re-offending. We also found that TCs were
effective in several different types of samples, which suggests that TCs can be
applied to a wide-range of offenders. However, there was evidence of publication
bias in this area of research, and this bias appeared to cause the effectiveness of TC
programs to be over-estimated. This possibility tempers our findings.
Ten of the 30 evaluations of TC programs were evaluations of RSAT-funded
programs. These ten evaluations found evidence of effectiveness of RSAT programs
in reducing re-offending. Four of these evaluations assessed the impact of the RSAT
programs ’effectiveness on drug use. This limited evidence produced mixed results:
two evaluations found that participants had lower post-release rates of drug use, and
two evaluations found that participants had higher post-release rates of drug use,
than did non-participants. Thus, such evaluations are as likely to find reductions in
drug use as they are to find increases.
Similarly, the evidence regarding counseling programs indicated that these
programs were effective in reducing re-offending, but, once again, the limited
evidence available on these programs ’effects on drug use was unclear. The analyses
of odds ratios from evaluations of counseling programs revealed that, while
counseling programs had a larger mean odds ratio than evaluations of TC programs
on offending outcomes, the positive effects of counseling programs were more
contingent. Evidence of the effectiveness of counseling programs was strongest in
evaluations that were rated as methodologically weak, composed of adult offenders,
and strictly voluntary. Regrettably, counseling interventions generally were poorly
described by the primary authors, and, as a result, we were unable to code precise
program features that may have distinguished the most effective programs.
Interestingly, evaluations of both TC and counseling programs found that
treatment was somewhat more effective in samples of women than in samples of
either men or mixed genders. This finding is particularly interesting, as incarcerated
female offenders are disproportionately drug involved, and female offenders
traditionally have had limited access to high-quality treatment programs (see e.g.,
Pollock 2004 ).
A surprising finding was the smaller effects of both TC and counseling programs
on drug-relapse measures than on measures of re-offending. A presumption of these
programs is that their effectiveness in reducing re-offending is mediating by
reductions in drug use. As such, we would expect drug-relapse effects to be as large
as, or larger than, re-offending effects. An analysis of the relationship between drug
relapse odds ratios and re-offending odds ratios showed a strong relationship
between these two (unweighted correlation of 0.56 and a weighted correlation of
0.64), indicating that the larger a program ’s effect on drug-relapse the larger the
effect on recidivism (and vice versa), consistent with the notion that drug use
mediates criminality. This does not resolve, however, the counterintuitive finding of
lower drug-relapse effects. Two possibilities come to mind. First, although official
measures of recidivism are known to be only modestly reliable indicators of criminal
behavior, they may be more reliable than measures of drug-relapse. If this is true,
then the latter are attenuated to a greater degree than the former. Second, drug use
may not mediate the relationship between these programs and criminal behavior.
These programs may successfully change criminogenic attitudes, attachment of
antisocial peers, maladaptive cognitive processes, or other psychosocial character-370 O. Mitchell, et al.
istics of the offenders that maintain or foster their criminality, and, to a lesser degree,
their drug use. Additional research is needed that examines the role of reducing an
offender ’s drug use in reducing future non-drug-use criminal behavior.
We believe that the implications of this research for policy makers are clear.
Policy makers seeking effective interventions for incarcerated substance abusers are
most likely to find success with programs that focus on the multiple problems of
substance abusers in an intensive manner, such as TC programs. Policy makers
should expect smaller treatment benefits from less intensive treatment programs.
Further, there is no evidence that correctional boot camps targeted at substance
abusers reduce either post-release offending or drug use, and, thus, policy makers
should not expect these programs to produce reductions in recidivism.
We believe that this research also has implications for researchers. Specifically,
we believe that while the extant research clearly supports the effectiveness of certain
programs, there is a lack of understanding concerning which particular components
of treatment programs are most important and which combination of components are
most effective. Further, the general methodological weakness of this area of research
makes their findings vulnerable to alternative explanations (i.e., reductions in
recidivism could be due to factors other than the intervention). Beneficial future
research will address these issues.

Abstract 
 meta-analysis was conducted to determine if drug treatment cour ts reduce recidivism 
compared to traditional justice system res ponses.  After a comprehensive search of 
both the published and unpublis hed literature, 54 studies were located and deemed 
acceptable according to the study inclusion criteria.  Since studies oftentimes contained 
information on more than one program, data from 66 individual drug treatment court 
programs were aggregated and analyzed.  The results indicated that drug treatment courts significantly reduced the recidi vism rates of participants by 14% compared to offenders 
within the control/comparison groups.  Several variables identified in the analysis, however, 
had an impact on the results, including the age of  the participants, the length of the program, 
the follow-up period used to measure recidivism, and other methodological  variables (i.e., the 
use of random assignment and the choice of th e comparison group).  While there are other 
issues that were not the subject  of this research, such as th e cost-effectiveness of DTCs, the 
results of this meta-analysis pr ovides clear support for the use of drug treatment courts as a 
method of reducing crime among offenders with substance abuse problems.

1. Introduction 
rug treatment courts (DTCs) aim to reduce crime committed as a result of illicit drug 
dependency through court-monitored treatm ent and community service support for 
offenders with substance abuse problems.  Pa rticipants are generally referred to DTC 
programs through a number of sources, such as the courts or Crown prosecutors, and must 
meet a set of eligibility require ments (e.g., serious drug use, non-vi olent offences).  As part of 
their treatment, DTC participants typically attend counselling sessions  through a structured 
out-patient program (although some may attend in-p atient programs) and are typically subject 
to random drug tests during the program.  Particip ants must also appear regularly in court, 
where a judge reviews their progress and ofte n imposes sanctions for negative behaviour (e.g., 
verbal reprimands, incarceration, expulsion fr om the program) or provides rewards for 
positive behaviour (e.g., verbal commendations, reduc tions in the frequency of court contact).  
DTC staff in many programs also  work with community partners to address participants’ 
other needs, such as safe housing, stable empl oyment and vocational skills training.  Once  
a participant gains stability and demonstrates  control over the substance abuse problems, 
criminal charges may be stayed or, in some cases, the offender may receive a non-custodial sentence.  If unsuccessful, an offender will usually be sentenced as part of the regular  court process.  The first formal DTC in Canada was established in Toronto in 1998, followed by a second court in Vancouver in 2001.  As part of its  commitment under Canada’s Drug Strategy to 
expand drug treatment courts in Canada, the federal government announced in 2005 that 
additional funding would be provided to establis h four additional courts in Edmonton, Regina, 
Winnipeg and Ottawa.  In the United States, th ere are a substantial number of DTCs operating 
within many states.  Despite the popularity and intui tive appeal of DTCs, it is cr ucial to fully evaluate the 
effectiveness of such an approach, particularly as the cost of using th e courts as a social 
control mechanism is relatively high.  The main goal of DTCs is to reduce substance use and 
subsequently reduce criminal behaviour which is committed as a result of the substance abuse.  There have been numerous evaluati ons of individual DTCs, and the results have 
varied considerably.  Fielding, Tye, Ogawa,  Imam and Long (2002), for example, reported 
that participation in a drug treatment court was associated with significant reductions in 
recidivism compared to participation in the tr aditional court process, while Meither, Lu and 
Reese (2000) reported that DTC participation was associated with  an increase in recidivism.   
 Given that there are a relatively  high number of drug treatmen t court evaluations and that  
the results are difficult to in terpret individually, this body of  empirical knowledge would  
need to be aggregated.  Summarizing this re search through standard narrative approaches 
(e.g., literature review, annotat ed bibliography), however, w ould perhaps not analyze the 
available data objectively and might lead to inappropriate conclusions.  In order to  
objectively summarize this body of  research, a meta-analysis was selected as the most 
appropriate method. D 
 
A Meta-Analytic Examination of Drug Treatme nt Courts: Do They Reduce Recidivism?  
  
 
2  |  Research and Statistics Division / Department of Justice Canada A meta-analysis can be understood as a statistical analysis of a collection of studies that 
aggregates the magnitude of a relationship be tween two or more variables (Glass, McGaw  
& Smith, 1981).  Meta-analytic stat istics can describe the typical strength of the effect under 
investigation (i.e., chan ge in recidivism as a result of DTC participation), the degree of 
statistical significance, and the variability, a nd can provide an opportunity to explore and 
identify potential moderating variables.  The out come of a meta-analysis is an effect size 
estimate (ESE), which can be interpreted as the estimated effect of the independent variable 
on the dependent variable.  For example, an average effect size estimate of +0.10 translates 
into the independent variable  accounting for a 10% change in the dependent variable 
(Rosenthal, 1991).  Meta-analytic reviews are genera lly regarded as a superior method of research synthesis 
compared to traditional narrative reviews as the former are “more systematic, more explicit, 
more exhaustive, and more quantitative” (Rosen thal 1991, p. 17).  Critic s argue, however, that 
one of the major limitations of meta-analytic t echniques is that the sampling procedures are 
biased in favour of including predominantly published studies.  It  is surmised that, since the 
probability of publishing a study is increased by the statistical significance of the results, 
published studies are not actually representative of  the entire body of research that has been 
conducted in a given area.  Consequently, a calculated effect size, based exclusively on 
published studies, may be overestimating the rela tionship.  Coined the “file drawer problem” 
(Rosenthal, 1991, p. 103), this suggests that if un published studies were included in the meta-
analysis, the effect size estimate would be smaller.   In order to counter this issue, unpublished 
articles, governmental and non-governmental report s, and student papers were sought in the 
present meta-analysis.

2.  Method 
imilar to traditional quantitative research methods, the meta-analytic process involves 
three basic steps:  
1. literature review – identifying and ga thering relevant research studies; 
2. data collection – extracting data through pre-determin ed coding procedures; and 
3. data analysis – analyzing the aggregat ed data using statistical techniques. 
 To gather eligible studies for the meta-analysi s, a comprehensive search was conducted of the 
literature over the last 20 years includi ng unpublished doctoral theses and governmental 
reports.  A secondary search was conducted using th e bibliographies of th e relevant literature, 
prior meta-analyses and the Internet.  An explicit  set of criteria was established in order for a 
study to be included in the analysis:  
1. the study examined the effectiveness of a drug treatment court (i.e., an intervention that involved both a court monitored com ponent and a substance abuse treatment 
component) for offenders charged with a criminal offence; 
 
2. the study used a control group or comparis on group that did not experience the drug 
treatment court (or provided sufficient pre/post data);  
 
3. sufficient statistical information was reported in order to extract an effect size; and, 
 
4. the study measured the impact of the DTC on recidivism rates.  
 Standardized information was drawn from each  accepted study using a pre-designed coding 
manual.  In accordance with standard meta-a nalytic techniques, multiple definitions of 
recidivism were accepted.  For example, reci divism was defined as a new conviction or 
simply a new charge.  It was not, however, defined as a relapse on the substance of choice – only new criminal behaviour was co ded as recidivism.  In order to generate sufficient data for 
analysis, several coding techniques were used.  For example, if 70% or more of the study 
sample were first-time offenders, it was coded as  a “primarily first-time offender program.”  
In addition, several variables were coded onl y if the authors made an explicit positive 
statement.  For example, the use of methadone was only coded as “yes” if the authors directly 
stated this to be a fact.  Therefore, the compar isons made in this repo rt are subject to this 
limitation.  It should be noted, howev er, that this is a general issu e within all meta-analyses.   
 In accordance with the meta-analytic techniques of Rosenthal (1991), the phi  coefficient 
(Pearson’s r  product moment correlation applied to dich otomous data) was used as the effect 
size estimate.  In cases where multiple control groups were used in a single study, the results 
were combined in order to generate a single ESE for each program in order to avoid skewing 
the results by double counting programs.  In addition, where multiple follow-up periods were 
reported in a single study, th e longer period was selected. S

Once the ESE from each study was calculated fo r recidivism, the overall mean effect size 
estimate, along with the corre sponding confidence intervals, and a weighted effect size 
estimate were calculated.  Additional analyses we re also conducted to explore whether certain 
variables had a moderating impact on ESE ma gnitude where adequate information was 
available.  For example, the effect of DTC participation was analyzed based upon the length 
of the programs or the criminal history of the offenders within the programs.

3.  Results 
3.1  Study Characteristics 
lthough 185 individual studies were identified through the search process, only 54 
(29.2%) studies were deemed acceptable accordi ng to the study inclusion criteria.  As 
Table 1 indicates, the research located on drug treatment courts originates almost 
exclusively from the United States.  Only two studies were located in Canada (which is 
consistent with the number of Canadian DTCs  that were operating long enough to generate 
evaluations) and two in Australia.

The studies were published between 1993 and 2005 with a median year of 2001.  Just over 
half (57.4%) were published in peer-reviewed aca demic journals, which indicates that this 
meta-analysis is not relying sole ly on “traditionally published” studies.  A large majority of 
the studies (87.0%) used a comparison group (simple or matched).  Although the 
control/comparison groups were combined in th e calculation of the ESE,  there was a total of 
72 unique control/comparison groups within the 54 studies.  Most compared the DTC 
participants to offenders within the traditional jus tice system (54.2%) or offenders who were A

group as these offenders would have been screened for substance abuse problem s.  
 
One of the more important issues within progra m evaluation research, and particularly within 
DTC research, is the attrition rate (i.e., the proportion of pa rticipants who voluntarily or 
involuntarily leave the program be fore completion).  The recidivism rates used in analysis do 
not include (or rarely include) offenders who did not complete the progra m.  Therefore, it is 
important to consider attrition when examining recidivism rates.  The attrition rates within the 
studies in this meta-analysis ranged fr om 9.0% up to 84.4% with a mean of 45.2% ( SD=19.0), 
which indicates that almost ha lf of DTC participants do not complete the program.  Clearly, 
strategies need to be developed to decrease attrition rates within DTC programs.    A second important factor to consider in a study of  recidivism is the follow-up length used to 
measure recidivism.  Generally, longer follow-up  periods produce higher recidivism rates as 
offenders have more time at-risk to re-o ffend.  The follow-up length used to measure 
recidivism within the included studies ranged fro m 3 months up to 48 months with a mean of 
18.7 months ( SD=11.5). 
 Sample size is a third factor considered importa nt in program evaluation research as larger 
sample sizes are considered more rigorous than smaller sample sizes.  The sample sizes ranged from 39 participants up to 856 partic ipants, with a mean of 260 participants (SD =189).   
3.2  Program Characteristics 
Although there were 54 individual studies, some studies reported on multiple DTCs.  As such, a total of 66 individual DTC programs were in cluded in this meta-analysis.  Table 2 
summarizes the DTCs described in  the individual research studie s.  The data, however, should 
be viewed with some caution.  There were diffi culties in coding detailed information, as the 
programs were not adequately descri bed in many of the studies.   
 Very few DTCs restricted participation based upon drug type.  Some programs (4.6%) 
restricted access to only hard  drug users (e.g., cocaine, heroin, crystal methamphetamine), and 
other programs (7.6%) to only soft-drug users (e.g., marijuana, hashish, alcohol).  Approximately one-third of programs (31.8%) d ealt primarily with repeat offenders (19.7% 
mostly repeat offenders and 12.1% all repeat o ffenders) and 19.7% dealt primarily with first-
time offenders (18.2% mostly first-time offenders  and 1.5% all first-time offenders).  Finally, 
almost all DTC programs (93.9%) accepted only  offenders who had been charged with non-
violent offences.  In summary, the programs in th is meta-analysis are dealing with both first-
time and repeat non-violent offenders who ha ve substance abuse problems with numerous 
types of drugs.      The program lengths of DTCs (i.e., the time an  offender was monitored) within this meta-
analysis varied from 6 months up to 26 months with a mean of 13.4 months ( SD=4.0).

 The identified studies sometimes indicated specific components of the DTC programs under 
scrutiny.  For example, in recognition that subs tance abuse and crimina lity are often linked to 
other factors, some programs targeted a number of additional areas such as academic skills, vocational skills, and family functioning.  Ta ble 3 provides information on the additional 
treatment targets reported in the studies.  It should be noted that the specific treatment 
components were only coded if there was an e xplicit indication in th e study that the DTC 
targeted that particular area.  Therefore, the figures in Table 3 may not  necessarily reflect the 
treatment programs accurately.  In  general, the DTC programs a ppear to target a number of 
additional issues beyond substance abuse.

3.3  Participant Characteristics 
In total, the studies examined 17,214 offe nders who had successfully completed drug 
treatment court programs and 14,505 offenders in the control or comparison groups.  The 
mean age of DTC participants recorded within  the studies was 28.4 year s – 7 studies provided 
data primarily on youth under 18 years of age.  Give n that the literature is almost exclusively 
American, Aboriginal identity was rarely reco rded.  Instead, when racial information was 
provided, the data was broken down according to categories such as Black, Hispanic or 
Caucasian.  However, these data were not av ailable often enough to include in the meta-
analysis.  Table 4 provides the gender breakdown within studies a nd indicates that most of the 
participants were male.

3.4  Recidivism Results 
The 66 DTC programs within this meta-analysis directly measured the effectiveness of 
treatment on reducing future criminal behavi our.  The mean overall ESE was + 0.14 with a 
95% confidence interval of + 0.10 to + 0.17.  By  converting the ESE into a Binomial Effect 
Size Display, a simple statement can be made:   
Generally, 57% of the participants in the drug treatment courts will not be 
charged with a new criminal offence during the follow-up period compared to 
43% of offenders within the control/comparison groups.   
 This can also be translated into a similar but more general statement:   
Drug treatment courts reduced recidivism rates by 14% compared to traditional criminal jus tice system responses. 
 There is, however, an explicit relationship between statistical significance, effect size and 
sample size whereby the size of a study increa ses the level of signifi cance (Rosenthal, 1991).  
In order to give more weight to studies w ith larger sample sizes, a weighted ESE was 
calculated according to the tech nique described by Hunter, Schmidt and Jackson (1982).  The 
weighted ESE was +0.13, which is relatively similar to the unweighted ESE.     
 As Figure 1 indicates, the majority of the DTC programs demonstrated a positive impact on 
recidivism (i.e., programs with an effect si ze above zero).  Only 10 studies indicated a 
negative impact while 56 studies demonstrated  a positive impact.  A single-sample t-test 
indicated that the mean effect size estim ate was significantly different from zero 
(t(df=65)=7.58, p< .001).  Therefore, in general, DTCs appear to decrease the likelihood of 
future criminal behaviour better than traditiona l justice responses.  Heterogeneity analysis, 
however, indicated that the variance in e ffect size estimates was also significant 
(
χ2(df=65)=465.3, p< .001). The moderating variables were, therefore, further examined to 
determine differences in effect based upon progr am characteristics, par ticipant characteristics 
and study characteristics.

3.5  Moderating Variable Analysis 
In order to understand the poten tial impact of moderating vari ables, individual ESEs were 
calculated across a number of different groups su ch as adults versus youth and first-time 
offenders versus repeat offenders.  Table 5 provid es the results of this analysis.  Variables  
that were not amenable to this form of an alysis (e.g., substantial amount of missing data, 
minimal variance) were not included.  As well,  due to missing data within some studies, the 
total number of effect size estimates within each  moderator analysis is not always equal to the 
total number of possible ESEs.  For exam ple, only 49 of the possible 66 ESEs had 
information regarding the age of the participants.  Fina lly, the additional treatment 
components reported in Table 3 (e.g., anger ma nagement, academic skills, vocational skills) 
were not used within the moderator analysis as  the information was deemed too unreliable.  
As indicated previously, it was only recorded when the authors made a direct statement that 
the component was part of the treatment.  In other words, the data is not necessarily an 
accurate reflection of the programs.  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22-.20 to -.11-.10 to -.010.0 to .09.10 to .19.20 to .29.30 to .39.40 to .49 .50 to .59Effect size

A Meta-Analytic Examination of Drug Treatme nt Courts: Do They Reduce Recidivism?  
  
 
12  |  Research and Statistics Division / Department of Justice Canada First, one of the noteworthy findings from the moderator analysis is the difference in the 
reported effectiveness of DTCs according to ag e.  When comparing youth and adults, the 
results indicate that DTCs are more effec tive for adults, although the difference is not 
statistically significant.  However, when ex amining the mean ESE for youth alone, the 95% 
confidence interval includes zero, thus dimini shing confidence that DTCs are actually 
effective with youth.  Confidence intervals give us a measure of the precision of the mean 
effect size estimate computed.  In this case, the 95% confidence interval implies that 19 times 
out of 20, the ‘true’ mean will fall within the prov ided range.  If this range includes zero, we 
cannot be statistically certain that there is an actual effect from DTC pa rticipation, as a zero 
ESE implies no difference between the DTC part icipants and the control/comparison group.  
Since there are only 7 ESEs contributing to the youth results, however, a dditional research is 
warranted to determine if the DTC model is, in fact, not e ffective with youth. 
 Second, the difference in the mean ESE based upon the follow-up length used to measure recidivism is important.  Those studies with l onger follow-up periods pr oduced larger effects 
compared to those with shorter follow-up period s.  Normally, recidivism rates increase with 
longer follow-up lengths as offenders have more time at-risk to re-offend and/or come to the attention of police.  Not surpri singly, the results of this meta-analysis follow this trend as 
recidivism rates generally increase within both DTC programs and control/comparison groups 
as the follow-up length increases.  The important  difference, however, is that the gap between 
the two groups increases over time.  In other words, as the follow-up time increases, those in 
the comparison group become even more likely to re-offend compared to the DTC participants.  It is therefore likely that the be nefits of DTC participat ion increase with time.  
As such, longer follow-up periods are particularly important in DTC research to fully understand the impact of pa rticipation on recidivism. 
 Third, it is not surprising that those evaluato rs who chose to randomly assign offenders into a 
treatment or control group gene rated diminished effects compar ed to those who did not use 
random assignment.  Previous research has demo nstrated that as the methodological rigour of 
a study increases, the reported effects decrease  (Latimer, 2001).  Further, the 95% confidence 
interval for the six studies that used random assignment actually incl uded zero and therefore 
diminishes confidence that DT Cs are effective when a random treatment/control design is 
used to measure effectiveness.  However, random assignment is difficult within this context as judges and lawyers often prefer (understandably) to prioritize treatment for those deemed 
most appropriate.  Therefore, in many of the studies that initially tr ied to implement random 
assignment procedures, the process was disc ontinued and replaced with a comparison group 
design.    The fourth finding from the moderator anal ysis is the fact that the choice of 
control/comparison group has a si gnificant impact on ESEs.  Studi es that used drop-outs or 
non-completers as a comparison group dem onstrated a significantly higher mean ESE 
(F(df=2)=6.87, p<.01) compared to studies that used a traditional justice system comparison 
group or offenders who were eligible but did no t participate.  These results are also not 
surprising given that drop-outs/non-completer s would logically provide a comparison group 
that are not as motivated as those who comple ted the program.  Those who were eligible for 
the program but did not participate likely form the most similar group for comparison as they 
 
 
  
 
Research and Statistics Division / Department of Justice Canada  |  13 
would have met the inclusion criteria (i.e., sc reened for substance abuse problems, similar 
criminal histories and offence types).  And wh en this group was used, DTC participation still 
demonstrated an 11% improvement in recidivism. 
 The fifth and final finding is the difference in reported effects based upo n the length of the 
DTC program.  Programs that provided serv ices for one year to eighteen months 
demonstrated a significant reduction in recidivism ( F(df=2)=3.76, p<.05) compared to shorter 
or longer programs.  In fact, the 95% confiden ce interval for shorter programs includes zero, 
which further reduces confidence that programs shorter than one year have a positive impact 
on recidivism.  It is possible th at the shorter time frame is not  sufficient for the cognitive and 
behavioural changes to become entrenched wh ile the longer timeframe may induce some form 
of “treatment fatigue.”     
 
A Meta-Analytic Examination of Drug Treatme nt Courts: Do They Reduce Recidivism?  
  
 
14  |  Research and Statistics Division / Department of Justice Canada 4.  Conclusion 
rug treatment courts are now operating within six major ci ties in Canada (Vancouver, 
Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, a nd Ottawa) and many cities across the 
United States.  The results of this meta-ana lysis suggest that such a response is an 
effective method of reducing future criminal be haviour compared to tr aditional responses.  
There are, however, several important  additional findings and caveats.   
 
First, it appears from the results of this meta-analysis that youth may not be suitable 
candidates for DTCs.  Additional research is warranted, however, given the low number of studies using a youth sample to furthe r examine a possible age effect.   
 Second, longer follow-up periods should be used  in DTC research as it is likely that the 
benefits of DTC participation in crease with time.  In fact, th e current findings suggest that 
sustained behavioural changes are a likely outcome of DTC participation.  Third, programs that provide services for one year to eighteen months are associated with improvements in recidivism compared to shor ter or longer programs.  It is therefore 
reasonable that services provide d to DTC participants should be  structured to range between 
one year and eighteen months.    Finally, methodology, as indicated in previous research (Latimer, 2001) , has a significant 
impact on the reported effects of DTC effectiven ess.  In this meta-analysis, two study design 
characteristics emerged as important – random assignment and comparison group selection.  It 
is understandable that random assignment is a di fficult approach to use in a criminal justice 
setting, particularly as DTCs are typically  voluntary programs a nd criminal justice 
professionals prefer to have influence over who ultimately participates.  However, the choice to use drop-outs and/or non-completers clearly influences the results and should be avoided.  
Nonetheless, even when those who are eligible but do not participate are used as a comparison 
group (which appears to be the most ri gorous method beyond random assignment), drug 
treatment courts still appear to have a positive impact on reducing recidivism.   While there are other issues that were not the subject of this research, such as the cost-
effectiveness of DTCs, the results of this meta -analysis, which includes data on more than 
17,000 offenders within 66 individual programs, provides clear support for the use of  drug treatment courts as a method of reduc ing crime among offenders with substance  
abuse problems.   D

with effective treatment

Abstract. A meta-analysis of 58 experimental and quasi-experimental studies of the effects of
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on the recidivism of adult and juvenile offenders conﬁrmed priorpositive ﬁndings and explored a range of potential moderators to identify factors associated withvariation in treatment effects. With method variables controlled, the factors independently associated
with larger recidivism reductions were treatment of higher risk offenders, high quality treatment im-
plementation, and a CBT program that included anger control and interpersonal problem solving but notvictim impact or behavior modiﬁcation components. With these factors accounted for, there was nodifference in the effectiveness of different brand name CBT programs or generic forms of CBT.
Key words: CBT, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatment, criminal rehabilitation,
evaluation, meta-analysis, offenders, recidivism, treatment effectiveness
Several well-conducted meta-analyses have identiﬁed cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) as a particularly effective intervention for reducing the recidivism of
juvenile and adult offenders. Pearson et al. (2002), for instance, conducted a meta-
analysis of 69 research studies covering both behavioral (e.g., contingencycontracting, token economy) and cognitive-behavioral programs. They found thatthe cognitive Ybehavioral programs were more effective in reducing recidivism than
the behavioral ones, with a mean recidivism reduction for treated groups of about30%. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Wilson et al. (2005) examined 20 studies ofgroup-oriented cognitive behavioral programs for offenders and found that CBTwas very effective for reducing their criminal behavior. In their analysis,
representative CBT programs showed recidivism reductions of 20 Y30% compared
to control groups.
Although these meta-analyses provide strong indications of the effectiveness of
cognitive Ybehavioral treatment for offenders, they encompassed considerable
diversity within the range of offender types, outcome variables, quality of studydesign, and (especially in Pearson et al. 2002) variations in what was counted as acognitiveYbehavioral treatment. A more circumscribed meta-analysis conducted by
Lipsey et al. (2001) examined 14 experimental and quasi-experimental studies that
emphasized cognitive change as the deﬁning condition of CBT, considered only
effects for general offender samples, and focused on reoffense recidivism as thetreatment outcome. The results showed that the odds of recidivating for offendersreceiving CBT were only about 55% of that for offenders in control groups. LipseyJournal of Experimental Criminology (2005) 1: 451–476 #Springer 2005
and Landenberger (2005) then focused further on an updated and overlapping set
of 14 randomized experiments and found that the mean recidivism for thetreatment groups in those studies was 27% lower than that of the control groups.
Variation in effectiveness
Meta-analysis has thus consistently indicated that CBT, on average, has signiﬁcant
positive effects on recidivism. However, there is also signiﬁcant variation acrossstudies in the effect sizes that contribute to those mean values that must beacknowledged. Identiﬁcation of the moderator variables that describe the studycharacteristics associated with larger and smaller effects is another kind of con-
tribution meta-analysis can make to understanding the effectiveness of CBT with
offenders. Of particular importance is the role such moderator analysis can play inascertaining which variants of CBT are most effective and for which offenders.
Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) identiﬁed a few factors that were related to
variation in recidivism effects. They found that treatment of high risk offenders,greater levels of CBT training for treatment providers, and CBT programs set upfor research or demonstration purposes (in contrast to Freal world _routine practice
programs) were associated with larger effects. What most characterized the research
and demonstration programs, in turn, was smaller sample sizes, greater monitoring
of offender attendance and adherence to the intervention plan (treatment ﬁdelitychecks), and providers with mental health backgrounds. These factors suggest thattreatment effectiveness is mainly a function of the quality of the CBT provided.
That meta-analysis involved only a small number of studies, however, and did
not permit much exploration of potential moderator variables. Wilson et al. (2005)computed mean effect sizes separately for Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT),Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R), and Fother_CBT programs. They found that
R&R showed somewhat smaller mean effects, but did not examine any other
moderator variables. Pearson et al. (2002), as noted above, compared the effects ofbehavioral and cognitive Ybehavioral programs and also reported larger effects for
better designed studies, but did not pursue further moderator analysis.
There has thus been only limited meta-analytic investigation of factors iden-
tiﬁable in the body of research on CBT that are associated with variation in itseffects on offender recidivism. The most likely candidates for such factors fall intocategories relating to the speciﬁc type of CBT program applied, the nature and
extent of its implementation, the characteristics of the offenders to whom it is
provided, and the study methods used to investigate its effects.
The type of CBT program, for instance, relates, ﬁrst, to the Fbrand name _
curriculum used, such as MRT and R&R as examined by Wilson et al. (2005).CBT programs also differ in the nature and mix of treatment elements included,e.g., whether oriented mainly toward cognitive restructuring exercises or cognitiveskills training and whether such topics as anger management, relapse prevention,interpersonal problem solving and moral reasoning are covered. Another po-
tentially important distinction is whether CBT constitutes virtually the full programNANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 452
offered or is combined with other services, e.g., educational classes, vocational
training, or mental health counseling.
Factors related to program implementation that might inﬂuence the effects of
CBT include, most centrally, how much treatment is provided. The duration of
CBT programs in correctional settings, for instance, varies from weeks to years and
may involve many meetings per week or less than one. The ﬁdelity of the im-plementation to the curriculum speciﬁcations may also be important along with thedegree of expertise possessed by the personnel providing the program. As men-tioned earlier, Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) found that programs implementedprincipally for research or demonstration purposes showed larger effects thanroutine practice programs. In these programs, the researchers themselves generallyexercise control over the various phases and facets of implementation. The
treatment provided to offenders in those circumstances almost certainly differs in
important ways from that provided when the program under everyday conditions incriminal justice settings.
Among the characteristics of the offenders participating in CBT that may in-
ﬂuence the outcome are age, gender, and ethnic background as well as criminalhistory and other such risk indicators. The Frisk principle _of Andrews et al. (1990),
for instance, posits that effective treatment will have greater impact on higher-risk offenders because they have more room for improvement than lower-risk
offenders.
Finally, there is good reason to believe that the methods and procedures used in
the research will inﬂuence the magnitude of the observed effects. Randomassignment studies are expected to yield unbiased results while ﬁndings fromnonrandomized comparisons may over or understate effects. Weisburd et al.(2001), for example, found larger effects in nonrandomized studies of criminaljustice programs though, for CBT, Pearson et al. (2002) reported larger effects forstudies of higher methodological quality. After assignment to conditions, attrition
from outcome measurement can also bias effect estimates if, as is likely, it is not
randomly distributed across conditions. The operationalization of the outcomemeasure is another potential source of difference. Even when the focus is onrecidivism, some studies index it with the rate of rearrest, others by assessingreconvictions, incarcerations, probation or parole violations, and the like. More-over, the timing of recidivism measurement varies, ranging from a period close tothe end of treatment to months or years later.
Purpose of this meta-analysis
The objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationships of selected
moderator variables to the effects of CBT on the recidivism of adult and juvenileoffenders. In order to have a sufﬁcient number of studies to permit examinationof between-study differences, an especially thorough search was made of the
available research. To assist in expanding the number of studies, and to ensureEFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS 453
methodological diversity so that variation in methods could be investigated, quasi-
experimental studies were included as well as randomized ﬁeld experiments.Though not all potentially interesting moderator variables are reported well enoughin the source studies to allow systematic comparison, a detailed coding protocol
was applied to extract as much relevant information for analysis as possible from
each study report.
Methods
Criteria for inclusion of studies
Studies were assessed and selected for this meta-analysis if they met the following
criteria:
Intervention
The treatment under investigation was a variant of cognitive Ybehavioral therapy
representing or substantially similar to such recognized Fbrand name _CBT
programs as Reasoning and Rehabilitation (Ross and Fabiano 1985), MoralReconation Therapy (Little and Robins on 1986), Aggression Replacement
Training (Goldstein and Glick 1987), the Thinking for a Change curriculum (Bush
et al. 1997), and the Cognitive Interventions Program (NIC, 1996). In particular, itwas directed toward changing distorted or dysfunctional cognitions (cognitiverestructuring) or teaching new cognitive skills and involved therapeutic techniquestypically associated with CBT, i.e., structured learning experiences designed toaffect such cognitive processes as interpreting social cues, monitoring one’s ownthought processes, identifying and compensating for distortions and errors inthinking, reasoning about right and wro ng behavior, generating alternative
solutions, and making decisions about appropriate behavior. If CBT was offered
in the context of a multimodal program that simultaneously provided otherservices, the CBT must have been provided to all participants and constitute amajor component of the program.
Participants
The recipients of the intervention were criminal offenders, either juveniles oradults, treated while on probation, inca rcerated/institutionalized, or during
aftercare/parole. Offenders were drawn from a general offender population and
not selected for, or restricted to, those committing speciﬁc types of offenses (e.g.,sex offenses, DUI, drug offenses, status offenses).
Outcome measures
The study reported criminal offending subsequent to treatment as an outcomevariable. Outcome results were presented in a quantitative form that permittedcomputation or reasonable estimation of an effect size statistic representing the
difference in recidivism rates between treated and untreated offenders.NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 454
Research methods
The study used a randomized or quasi-experimental design that compared a CBTtreatment condition with a control condition that did not include CBT treatment.Quasi-experimental designs were eligible only if subjects in the treatment and
control conditions were matched or statistically controlled on pre-treatment risk-
related variables (e.g., relevant personal, demographic, and criminal backgroundcharacteristics) or if pre-treatment measures of criminal or antisocial behavior orsigniﬁcant risk factors for such behavior were reported in a form that permittedassessment of the initial equivalence of the treatment and control groups. Toeliminate explicit self-selection as a biasing factor in group assignment, however,studies were not included if the control groups were created with individuals whobegan CBT but dropped out prior to completing treatment or who were offered
CBT and refused. Control groups could represent placebo, wait-list, no treatment,
orFtreatment as usual _conditions, with the latter restricted to cases of clearly
routine probation, institutional, or aftercare/parole practices.
Source
Both published and unpublished studies were eligible for inclusion, conducted inany country, and reported in any language.
Search strategy
An initial set of eligible studies came from those assembled and analyzed for the
Lipsey et al. (2001) and Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) meta-analyses. Thisnumber was expanded through a comprehensive search using the followingprocedures.
Meta-analysis databases
The second author has constructed a meta-analysis database of coded studies for
interventions with juvenile offenders based on a comprehensive search for studiesreported in 2002 or earlier. All the studies in that database were reviewed foreligibility and an independent search was conducted for studies published after2002. In addition, the studies in a database of interventions with adult offendersthat is nearing completion were reviewed for eligibility.
Database searches
Computerized bibliography searches were conducted for studies reported from
1965 through 2005. To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst systematic applicationsof CBT to offenders were developed and published in the mid-1970s (e.g.,Yochelson and Samenow 1976); searching back to 1965 was aimed at ensuring thatnone were missed. The keywords for searching were concatenations of wordsdescribing the population (e.g., inmates, offenders), CBT treatment (e.g., cognitive,CBT, criminal thinking), and effectiveness research (e.g., outcomes, evaluation,effectiveness). The databases searched included the Campbell Collaboration
Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register (C2-EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS 455
SPECTR), Dissertation Abstracts On line, ERIC, MEDLINE, The National
Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), PsychInfo/PsychLit, SociologicalAbstracts, and a number of others.
Cross-referencing of bibliographies
Relevant review articles, meta-analy ses, and primary studies reviewed for
eligibility were scanned for citations to potentially eligible studies.
Internet searches
Relevant government websites (e.g., NIJ, NIC, OJJDP, Home Ofﬁce) as well asfoundation, professional associations and policy research ﬁrm websites weresearched. In addition, keyword searches were conducted using search engines such
asgoogle.com.
Journals
Vanderbilt University subscribes to a large number of electronic journals and thefull text of those judged relevant was searched with selected keywords. Majorjournals publishing empirical studies related to crime and delinquency were alsohand searched for eligible studies.
Informal sources
Unpublished results from evaluations of two CBT programs were available fromthe ﬁrst author, and several colleagues alerted us to eligible studies that were notaccessible through the above channels.
The search for CBT studies on adult offenders produced 2,947 study citations
with 771 reports judged promising enough to retrieve for closer examination. Thesearch for juvenile offender studies produced 1,487 study citations with 299 reportsretrieved. Review of the retrieved studies ultimately identiﬁed 58 studies meeting
the criteria for inclusion in the present meta-analysis.
Data management and extraction
Descriptive and outcome data were coded for each of the 58 eligible studies using
a coding protocol developed speciﬁcally for this purpose. Table 1, presented later,shows the major coding categories used for descriptive information. Recidivismoutcomes were reported in several different forms but, in virtually all instances,either the proportions of offenders in each research condition that recidivated werespeciﬁed or information was provided from which the proportions could be esti-mated. When more than one recidivism outcome was reported, only one was se-
lected for analysis using criteria that maximized cross-study similarity on the
variables and times of measurement. This procedure favored rearrest recidivism,then reconviction and incarceration in that order, and the measure taken closest to12 months post-treatment.NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 456

The selected recidivism outcomes were coded as odds ratios representing the
odds ofFsuccess_(not recidivating) for treatment group participants relative to the
odds for control participants. For binary outcomes, the odds ratio provides an effectsize statistic that has favorable properties and yields readily interpretable results
(Haddock et al. 1998). Statistical analysis with odds ratios is facilitated if they are
represented by their log, so the logged odds ratios were used in all analyses.Otherwise, the statistical analysis was conducted using conventional meta-analysistechniques (Lipsey and Wilson 2001) with each effect size weighted by its inversevariance in random effects analyses.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 58 studies included in the meta-
analysis. Several features of this research are notable. Randomized designs,matched designs, and group comparisons using neither of these procedures arerepresented in roughly equal numbers and involve a wide range of sample sizes.Attrition from outcome measurement is virtually zero in a majority of the studiesbut ranges over 30% in some of the remaining ones. About half the programsstudied were implemented as routine practice with the other half set up and
implemented by researchers as either demonstration or research programs, with
demonstration programs deﬁned as those mounted mainly for research purposesbut at a scale and in a manner somewhat more representative of actual practicethan those categorized as research programs. More studies were conducted withadult than juvenile offenders and most used only or predominately male offenders.Treatment was administered while the offenders were incarcerated in a correctionalinstitution in nearly half the studies and generally lasted less than 20 weeks. Inmost instances, the treatment providers had little or no evident mental health
background and had received relatively minimal training in cognitive behavioral
therapy. The treatment was typically one of the Fbrand name _manualized CBT
programs and incorporated multiple treatment elements.
Effect size variation associated with study methodsThe mean odds ratio representing the average effect of intervention was 1.53 ( pG
0.001), indicating that the odds of success (no recidivism in the post-intervention
interval of approximately 12 months) for individuals in the treatment group were
more than one and a half times as great as those for individuals in the controlgroup. In relation to the mean recidivism rate for the control groups of about 0.40,this odds ratio indicates a recidivism reduction of 25% to 0.30. There was alsosigniﬁcant variation across studies in the odds ratio for intervention effects ( Q=
214.02, df= 57, pG0.001). We turn now to an examination of the study
characteristics associated with that variation.
The recidivism effects observed in the studies in this meta-analysis are
potentially inﬂuenced by both the metho dological characteristics of the studiesNANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 460
and the substantive attributes of the tr eatments and the recipients. One of the
ﬁrst steps in the analysis, therefore, w as to determine which methodological
features were correlated with the effect sizes so they could be controlledwhile examining relationships with substa ntive attributes. The method variables
available from the study coding and considered relevant for this purpose were as
follows:
(a) Design, categorized as randomized, matched, or neither, each dummy coded to
produce three design variables.
(b) Design problem Yindications of initial nonequivalence between groups on pre-
treatment variables, or problems during or after the intervention that couldhave led to nonequivalence of the treatment and control group, rated by thecoder on a three-point scale (1 = favors control group; 2 = favors neither orinsufﬁcient evidence; 3 = favors treatment group).
(c) Attrition proportion Ythe proportion of the total initial sample (treatment plus
control group) for which recidivism outcome data were not available.
(d) Intent to treat, coded yes/no for whether treatment dropouts were retained in
the treatment group for the recidivism outcome data reported in the study.
(e) Type of recidivism, categorized as rearrests, reconvictions, incarcerations, or
other with each dummy coded to produce four recidivism variables.
(f) Recidivism interval represented by the number of months posttreatment over
which recidivism was measured. Because of the possibility of more frequentrecidivism in early months than later ones, the log of this variable was alsoused in the analysis.

Table 2 shows the zero-order correlation of each of the method variables with the
recidivism effect sizes (represented as logged odds ratios). These are inverse-variance weighted, random effects analyses with the random effects componentestimated using maximum likelihood techniques (Raudenbush 1994).
As Table 2 reports, there was no signiﬁcant relationship overall between the
effect sizes and the study design. In particular, the effects observed in randomizedstudies did not differ signiﬁcantly from those observed in matched studies or thosewith comparison groups that were neither matched nor randomly assigned. Norwas a signiﬁcant relationship observed for the coder’s rating of whether there wasan evident design problem favoring the control or treatment group, that is,indications of nonequivalence that might affect recidivism outcomes. Similarly,there were no signiﬁcant correlations with the attrition proportion, the way
recidivism was measured, or the interval over which it was measured.
The only methodological variable that showed a signiﬁcant ( pG0.10)
relationship with the effect size was whether the study presented the treat-mentYcontrol contrast as an intent-to-treat analysis. When the treatment dropouts
were included in the outcome recidivism, the effect sizes were smaller than whenthey were excluded, as would be expected. In light of this indication that the intent-to-treat variable might inﬂuence effect sizes, it was carried forward as a controlvariable for the analysis of the relationships between effect sizes and substantive
factors relating to the treatment and recipients. As a further precaution against
confounds with methodological characteristics, the other three method variableswith zero-order correlations of 0.10 or greater were also included as methodcontrols (design problem, attrition proportion, and rearrest recidivism).
Effect size variation associated with the treatment and its recipients
The relationship between the recidivism effect sizes and each of the descriptive
variables for CBT treatment and its recipients (see listing in Table 1) was nextexamined with the four selected method variables included as controls. Theseanalyses were conducted with a set of random effects multiple regressions thatincluded a descriptive variable and the four control variables. These were runseparately for each descriptive variable in this initial analysis to ensure that anyhaving potentially important relationships with effect size were identiﬁed despitewhatever correlations they had with other variables in the set. Because of the
modest number of studies and the broad conﬁdence intervals associated with
random effects analysis, alpha = 0.10 was set as the threshold for statistical signi-ﬁcance. Table 3 presents the results.
The variables in Table 3 are grouped into categories that represent different
aspects of the studies and the nature of the CBT treatment studied. The mostgeneral study characteristics (country, type of publication, and date of publication)showed no signiﬁcant relationships with effect size. The other candidate moderatorvariables are grouped according to a simple model that assumes that, with method
variables controlled, treatment effects will be a function of the characteristics ofNANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 462

the participants, the amount of treatment received, the quality of the treatment
implementation, and the speciﬁc type of treatment.
Participant characteristics
Of the characteristics of the treatment recipients that could be coded from moststudies, only the recidivism risk rating was signiﬁcantly related to the effect sizes.This rating was made by the coder on the basis of the description in the study ofthe criminal history of the treated offenders and the recidivism rate of the controlgroup. That rating, in turn, was not signiﬁcantly correlated with any of the other
variables describing the participants shown in Table 3. It is worth noting that there
was no relationship between effect size and whether the treated offenders werejuveniles or adults. The gender mix of the CBT recipients also showed norelationship to effect size but, as Table 1 shows, most of the samples were all maleor predominately male so there was little variation on this measure.
Amount of CBT
Dosage variables were coded as the number of sessions per week, the number of
hours of treatment per week, the total hours of treatment, and the number of weeksof treatment from beginning to end (see Table 1). The distributions for the latterthree had long tails and the logged values of these variables were used in theanalysis (and showed stronger relationships to effect size than the unloggedversions). As Table 3 shows, all these variables except length of treatment weresigniﬁcantly related to effect size. T otal hours, which showed the largest
relationship, however, is a function of both the number of hours per week and
the number of weeks. The study-level correlations among these variables showed
that length of treatment was signiﬁcantly related to total hours ( r= 0.51) as were
the number of sessions per week ( r= 0.58) and number of hours per week ( r=
0.75), with the latter two being highly correlated with each other ( r= 0.81).
From this pattern of relationships we concluded that the best representation of
the amount of treatment should distinguish the number of sessions or hours perweek from the length of the treatment. That approach allows further examinationof the ﬁnding in Table 3 that number of sessions and hours per week are related to
the effect size but, apparently, the duration of treatment is not. Between the
number of sessions per week and the number of hours, sessions showed theBehavior modiﬁcation 0.03

stronger relationship to effect size. Table 3 also shows the interaction between
number of sessions and length of treatment, but it was not signiﬁcantly related toeffect size.
Quality of CBT implementation
In this category we include the practice-research dimension that distinguishesbetween CBT treatments implemented on a routine basis in real-world criminaljustice contexts, demonstration programs in similar circumstances but withsigniﬁcant inﬂuence by the researcher, and research programs implemented bythe researchers largely for research purposes. Our assumption is that theprogressively greater involvement of researchers translates into better implemen-tation and more ﬁdelity to the treatment protocol.
Table 4 shows that the study-level correlations were all signiﬁcant between the
practice-research variable and the other variables assumed related to implemen-tation quality listed in Table 3 Yproportion of dropouts from treatment, extent of
implementation monitoring reported, amount of CBT training indicated forproviders, and the mental health background of the providers. Table 3 showsrelationships in the expected direction with effect size for all these variablesexcept providers’ mental health background, though only proportion of treat-ment dropouts and the practice-research dimension reached statistical signiﬁcance.
To summarize the relationship of these implementation quality variables to effect
size, a composite variable was created in the form of a factor score from a principalcomponents analysis. As shown in Table 3, that composite implementation factor ismore strongly related to the effect sizes than any of the component variables.
Other program characteristics
Table 3 also shows the relationship between effect size and two other programcharacteristics. One is the setting within which CBT was provided, differentiated

between treatment while incarcerated and treatment in the community (e.g., for
probationers and parolees); this variable was not signiﬁcantly related to effect size.The extent to which CBT was emphasized in the treatment program, on the otherhand, did show a signiﬁcant relationship. That variable ranged across categories of
CBT supplemented by other services, CBT with some other treatment elements, and
CBT alone. As the negative sign on the coefﬁcient in Table 3 shows, the effects aresigniﬁcantly larger when CBT is combined with other services. Examples of suchcomponents include mental health counseling, employment and vocational training,and educational programs.
Speciﬁc nature of the CBT treatment
The last two sections of Table 3 show two alternative ways of representing the
speciﬁc nature of the CBT treatment provided. One set of dummy-coded itemsdifferentiates the various major named types of CBT along with a somewhat moregeneric category of CBT programs focusing on substance abuse and two residualcategories of less common but manualized treatments and a few that do not appearto be manualized. None of these program variables is signiﬁcantly related to effectsize, meaning that no brand of CBT produces effects that stand out from theaverage of the other brands.
The other way we coded CBT treatment was in terms of the speciﬁc treatment
elements identiﬁed in the descriptions provided in the study reports. Those de-scriptions varied in detail and extensiveness but when they mentioned a distincttreatment element, we coded it as present using a dummy code. The elements thatappeared with sufﬁcient frequency to support analysis are shown in Table 3, de-ﬁned brieﬂy as follows:
/C15Cognitive skills: Training on general thinking and decision-making skills suchas to stop and think before acting, generate alternative solutions, evaluateconsequences, and make decisions about appropriate behavior.
/C15Cognitive restructuring: Activities and exercises aimed at recognizing andmodifying the distortions and errors that characterize criminogenic thinking.
/C15Interpersonal problem solving: Training in problem-solving skills for dealingwith interpersonal conﬂict and peer pressure.
/C15Social skills: Training in prosocial behaviors, interpreting social cues, taking
other persons’ feelings into account, and the like.
/C15Anger control: Training in techniques for identifying triggers and cues that
arouse anger and maintaining self-control.
/C15Moral reasoning: Activities designed to improve the ability to reason about rightand wrong behavior and raise the level of moral development.
/C15Victim impact: Activities aimed and getting offenders to consider the impact oftheir behavior on their victims.
/C15Substance abuse: Application of any of the typical CBT techniques speciﬁcallyto the issue of substance abuse.
/C15Behavior modiﬁcation: Behavioral contracts and/or reward and penalty schemesdesigned to reinforce appropriate behavior.NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 466
/C15Relapse prevention: Training on strategies to recognize and cope with high-risk
situations and halt the relapse cycle before lapses turn into full relapses.
/C15Individual attention: Any individualized one-on-one treatment element that
supplements CBT group sessions, e.g., individual counseling.
As Table 3 shows, the presence of some of these treatment elements in the CBT
program was signiﬁcantly related to effect sizes. The strongest relationship appeared
for individual attention, followed by anger control and cognitive restructuring.
The relative inﬂuence of different moderator variables
The results presented in Table 3 identify a number of variables describing the
participants and the CBT interventions that are related to treatment effects with keymethod variables controlled. Each of these moderator variables represents a way to

differentiate the circumstances of CBT treatment that yield larger and smaller
effects on recidivism. The variable-by-variable results in Table 3, however, do nottell us about the relative inﬂuence of the different moderators. To examine theindependent relationships of these variables with the others taken into account, two
summary random effects regression analyses were conducted. These were con-
ﬁgured to model the treatment effect sizes as a function of participant character-istics, the amount of CBT, the quality of the CBT, and the speciﬁc type of CBT,with method differences controlled.
Drawing on the results in Table 3, the relevant participant characteristics were
represented by recidivism risk, the only variable in that set signiﬁcantly related toeffect size. The amount of CBT was represented by the combination of variables

previously designated for that purpose Ysessions per week, length in weeks, and
their interaction. The quality of the CBT implementation was represented by thecomposite implementation factor, also described earlier. The type of CBT wasrepresented in the ﬁrst analysis as the set of brand name categories (with the two
Fother_categories omitted as a reference set). In the second it was represented in
terms of the speciﬁc treatment elements identiﬁed as present in the intervention. Inboth analyses, the CBT emphasis variable was also included to add informationabout the primacy of CBT in the overall intervention.
Table 5 shows the results when the CBT was represented in brand name
categories. Once again, no speciﬁc type of CBT program had effects signiﬁcantlydifferent from the mean of all the other types. Only two moderator variableswere individually signiﬁcant in this analysis Yrecidivism risk (higher risk was
associated with larger effects) and the composite implementation factor (higher
quality implementation was associated with larger effects).
Table 6 shows the parallel analysis with the CBT intervention represented in
terms of treatment elements. As in the previous analysis, recidivism risk and highquality implementation were associated with better outcomes. In addition, how-ever, four of the individual treatment elements showed signiﬁcant relationshipswith effect size. Interpersonal problem solving and anger control were positivelyrelated; their presence was associated with larger effects on recidivism. Victim
impact and behavior modiﬁcation were negatively related; they were associated
with worse outcomes.
Effects of FBest practice _CBT on recidivism
We can use the multiple regression analysis in Table 6 to explore optimal CBT
treatment circumstances by predicting the effect size expected in a favorable
scenario. For this purpose we assumed the best quality study method andmeasurement characteristics (no design problems, zero attrition, intent-to-treatanalysis, and an arrest recidivism outcome). We also assumed the subject samplewas comprised of moderately high risk offenders who received the median numberof sessions per week (two) with high quality implementation over the mediannumber of weeks (16). The CBT treatment assumed was any one of the brandname programs alone (not supplemented with other services), but with anger
control and interpersonal problem-solving components included.
When the corresponding variable values are entered into the prediction equation
represented in Table 6, the predicted effect size is a logged odds ratio of 1.05,corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.86. Compared to a control group recidivismof 0.40 (the overall mean), this represents a decrease to a recidivism rate of 0.19in the treatment group, that is, a 52% decrease overall. This impressive effect isnot a mathematical projection beyond what appears in the data. An odds ratio of2.86 is at the 82nd percentile of the distribution of effects for the 58 studies in this
meta-analysis.EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS 469
Discussion
This meta-analysis conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of positive CBT effects on the re-
cidivism of offenders that have been reported in other recent meta-analyses (Lipsey
et al. 2001; Lipsey and Landenberger (2005); Pearson et al. 2002; Wilson et al.
2005). The mean odds ratio indicated that the odds of not recidivating in the 12months after intervention for individuals in the treatment group were 1.53 times asgreat as those for individuals in the control group. This represents a reduction fromthe 0.40 mean recidivism rate of the control groups to a mean rate of 0.30 for thetreatment groups, a 25% decrease. The most effective conﬁgurations of CBTproduced odds ratios nearly twice as large as the mean, corresponding to re-cidivism rates of around 0.19 in the treatment groups, more than a 50% decrease
from the 0.40 rate of the average control group.
The main emphasis of this meta-analysis, however, was the search for key
moderator variables that would distinguish situations in which CBT producedlarger effects from those in which it produced smaller ones. On this issue, thereare two themes in the ﬁndings. First, a number of variables characterizing the sub-ject samples, amount and implementation of CBT, and the CBT treatment elementswere signiﬁcantly correlated with the effect sizes for recidivism outcomes. In thisregard, there are numerous moderators of the treatment effects. These are not all
independent relationships, however. Intervention studies tend to come with bundles
of co-occurring characteristics that are, therefore, correlated with each other acrossstudies. This confounding of moderator variables with each other makes it difﬁcultto identify those most critical to the outcome (Lipsey 2003).
Application of multiple regression analysis to identify the moderator variables
with the strongest independent relationships to effect size led to the second themein our ﬁndings. Of the many study characteristics that showed signiﬁcantrelationships with effect size, relatively few remained signiﬁcant when the
inﬂuence of the others was taken into account. The net result was that much of
the variation in recidivism effects could be explained by a small number ofmoderator variables. The only factors independently related to the effect sizes were(a) the risk level of the participating offenders, (b) how well the treatment wasimplemented, and (c) the presence or absence of a few treatment elements. In thelatter category, inclusion of anger control and interpersonal problem solvingcomponents in the treatment program were associated with larger effects; inclusionof victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation were associated with smaller effects.
Most striking was that, controlled for other moderators, none of the major CBT
brand name programs produced effects on recidivism that were signiﬁcantly largerthan the average effects of the other programs.
Though not informative for purposes of identifying the most effective treat-
ment conditions, the relationships between characteristics of the study methodsand the effects sizes were nonetheless interesting. The aspect of method that isusually of greatest concern for intervention studies is whether a randomized designwas used. For the studies included in this meta-analysis, however, there were no
signiﬁcant effect size differences between randomized and nonrandomized de-NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY 470
signs. Only the intent-to-treat variable, indicating whether treatment dropouts
were included in the outcome measures, was signiﬁcantly related to effect size andthat relationship dissipated when other moderators were included in the analysis.
Implications for practice
With the key participant and general implementation characteristics controlled, no
signiﬁcant differences were found in the effectiveness of the different types orFbrand names _of CBT. It thus appears to be the general CBT approach, and not
any speciﬁc version, that is responsible for the overall positive effects on recid-ivism. Within that framework, inclusion of distinct anger control and interper-sonal problem solving components in the CBT program enhance the effects while
victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation components appear to diminish it.
What seems to most strongly characterize effective CBT programs is high qual-
ity implementation as represented by low proportions of treatment dropouts, closemonitoring of the quality and ﬁdelity of the treatment implementation, and ade-quate CBT training for the providers. These characteristics are more closely asso-ciated with research and demonstration programs than with those implemented inroutine practice. This is an encouraging picture from the standpoint of practice. Itsuggests that any representative CBT program that is well-implemented might have
results in practice that approach the very positive effects on recidivism produced
by the most effective programs documented in the available research studies.
It is also encouraging that the effects of CBT were greater for offenders with
higher risk of recidivism than those with lower risk, contrary to any presumptionthat higher risk offenders might be less amenable to treatment. The effectiveness ofCBT with higher risk offenders is consistent with the principles of effectivecorrectional treatment developed by Andrews et al. (e.g., Andrews and Bonta2002; Andrews et al. 1990). They argue that the best results occur when higher-risk
offenders receive more intensive services that target criminogenic needs (e.g.,
criminal thinking pattern s) using cognitive behavioral and social learning
approaches.
From a practical standpoint, it is also worth highlighting a couple of variables
that were not related to treatment effects once other relevant program character-istics were controlled. In particular, CBT was as effective for juveniles as adults,other things equal, and thus should be useful in both juvenile justice and criminaljustice settings. The treatment setting was also not related to treatment effects.
Offenders treated in prison (generally close to the end of their sentences) showed
recidivism decreases comparable to those of offenders treated in the community(e.g., while on probation, parole or in transitional aftercare).
Implications for researchOf the 58 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, only 19 used random
assignment designs and, of those, only 13 maintained sufﬁciently low attrition from
outcome measurement to yield results with high internal validity. Moreover, onlyEFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS 471
six of the random assignment studies were conducted on Freal world _CBT practice;
the others were research and demonstration programs. The amount of high qualityresearch on CBT in representative correctional practice is not yet large enough todetermine whether the impressive effects on recidivism found in this meta-analysis
can be routinely attained under everyday circumstances.
Though generalization to routine practice cannot be assured, the consistency
and magnitude of the effects found in the research to date leave little doubt thatCBT is capable of producing signiﬁcant reductions in the recidivism of even highrisk offenders under favorable conditions. However, much remains to be learnedabout the optimal conﬁguration of CBT and the conditions under which it is mosteffective. In this meta-analysis we coded as much detail as possible about theprogram characteristics and context from the descriptions provided in the research
reports. At best, those descriptions were limited and fell well short of providing
full information about critical program details. An important direction for futureresearch is to better differentiate and document the dimensions along which CBTvaries in different applications and to identify the characteristics most critical forattaining optimal effects. The central issue for research on CBT with offenderpopulations at this juncture is not to determine if it has positive effects, but todetermine when and why it has the most positive effects.

Meta-analysisSexual o ﬀending
Domestic violenceGeneral violenceABSTRACT
A meta-analysis was conducted to examine whether specialized psychological o ﬀense treatments were associated
with reductions in o ﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism. Staﬀ and treatment program moderators
were also explored. The review examined 70 studies and 55,604 individuals who had o ﬀended. Three specialized
treatments were examined: sexual o ﬀense, domestic violence, and general violence programs. Across all pro-
grams, o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism was 13.4% for treated individuals and 19.4% for untreated comparisons over
an average follow up of 66.1 months. Relative reductions in o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism were 32.6% for sexual
oﬀense programs, 36.0% for domestic violence programs, and 24.3% for general violence programs. All pro-
grams were also associated with signi ﬁcant reductions in non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism. Overall, treatment
eﬀectiveness appeared improved when programs received consistent hands-on input from a quali ﬁed registered
psychologist and facilitating sta ﬀwere provided with clinical supervision. Numerous program variables ap-
peared important for optimizing the eﬀ ectiveness of specialized psychological o ﬀense programs (e.g., arousal
reconditioning for sexual o ﬀense programs, treatment approach for domestic violence programs). The ﬁndings
show that such treatments are associated with robust reductions in o ﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc
recidivism. We urge treatment providers to pay particular attention to sta ﬃng and program implementation
variables for optimal recidivism reductions.
1. Introduction
The overarching aim of o ﬀense speci ﬁc (i.e., specialized) psycho-
logical treatments for individuals who have o ﬀended is to reduce re-
cidivism. Knowing whether such treatments result in meaningful re-
cidivism reduction is crucial for informing future rehabilitative policy.Sexual o ﬀense and domestic violence programs comprise the lion's
share of specialized psychological programs o ﬀered in correctional and
community settings, although some programs have emerged targetinggeneral non-familial violence ( Cortoni, Nunes, & Latendresse, 2006;
Polaschek, 2006). To date, meta-analyses and reviews have been con-
ducted separately to examine sexual o ﬀense and domestic violence
programs. Evaluations of general violence programs have tended toeither group these in with sexual and domestic violence programs
(Dowden & Andrews, 2000 ) or focus broadly on violent o ﬀenders but
not violence speci ﬁc programs per se ( Jolliﬀe & Farrington, 2007 ). As
such, no review has yet synthesized all specialized treatments acrossthese three violent o ﬀending groups.

2. Sexual oﬀ ending
Meta-analyses examining sexual o ﬀense programs appear to in-
dicate some level of treatment e ﬀectiveness ( Alexander, 1999;
Gallagher, Wilson, Hirsch ﬁeld, Coggeshall, & MacKenzie, 1999 ;Hall,
1995 ;Hanson et al., 2002 ;Lösel & Schmucker, 2005 ;Schmucker &
Lösel, 2015 ). The three most comprehensive meta-analyses to date are
the best illustrations. Hanson et al. (2002) examined 43 evaluations of
specialized and non-specialized1psychological treatment for adults and
adolescents who had sexually o ﬀended ( N= 9454) and found sig-
niﬁcant unweighted average reductions for sexual recidivism (12.3%
treated vs. 16.8% untreated) and any general recidivism (27.9% treated
vs. 39.2% untreated). Although few program variables were examined,
Hanson et al. found that specialized treatments produced the best ef-
fects. Signi ﬁcant treatment e ﬀects were comparable across institutions
and community settings.
Lösel and Schmucker (2005) examined 69 treatment evaluations for
individuals who had sexually o ﬀended ( N= 22,181) —incorporating
biological (e.g., castration) and psychological treatments as well as
adult and adolescent clients —and found signi ﬁcant n-weighted relative
reductions for sexual (11.1% treated vs. 17.5% untreated), violent(6.6% treated vs. 11.8% untreated), and any general recidivism (22.4%
treated vs. 32.5% untreated). Biological treatments (vs. psychological)
produced the strongest treatment e ﬀects, as did treatments speci ﬁcally
targeting sexual o ﬀenses. Of the psychological treatments, only CBT
and behavioral approaches were e ﬀective. Quality of evaluation design
did not moderate the results, although studies with smaller samplesproduced stronger overall e ﬀects. Schmucker and Lösel (2015) later
updated this meta-analysis, restricting the inclusion criteria to only thehighest quality research designs (i.e., studies of at least quasi-experi-
mental design with between-group equality; 27 studies, N= 10,387).
This time, biological treatments did not meet inclusion criteria, and n-
weighted treatment e ﬀects for recidivism, although signi ﬁcant, were
notably smaller (sexual recidivism, 10.1% treated vs. 13.7% untreated;
general recidivism, 32.6% treated vs. 41.2% untreated). In addition,
only community programs (but not prison programs) signi ﬁcantly re-
duced sexual recidivism. Specialized psychological treatment targetingsexual o ﬀenses and treatment for adolescents also produced stronger
eﬀects, as did treatment that was individualized (rather than purely
group based). Schmucker and Lösel's study represents the latest au-
thoritative meta-analysis on psychological treatment for individuals
who have sexually o ﬀended.
One large scale single study evaluation ( N= 15,781) published by
Mews, Di Bella, and Purver (2017) for the UK Ministry of Justice ex-
amined the “Core ”sexual o ﬀense treatment program delivered to men
across prisons in England and Wales from 2000 to 2012. Mews et al.
(2017) propensity matched 87 variables to promote equivalence be-
tween the treated ( N=
2562) and untreated groups ( N= 13,219) and
found that sexual recidivism for treated individuals increased by an
absolute value of 2% and a relative value of 25% (10% treated vs. 8%
untreated) over a mean 8.2-year follow-up. The sheer scale and ap-
parent rigor of this individual study has cast signi ﬁcant international
doubt on whether individuals who have sexually o ﬀended can be re-
habilitated using specialized psychological programs (see Forde, 2017 ).
This is despite the fact that Mews et al.'s ﬁndings have not yet been
incorporated into a meta-analysis.
3. Domestic violence
Several reviews and meta-analyses have been published that focus
on treatment for domestic violence, each generating largely equivocal
ﬁndings ( Babcock, Green, & Robie, 2004 ;Davis & Taylor, 1999;Eckhardt et al., 2013; Feder & Wilson, 2005 ;Sartin, Hansen, & Huss,
2006 ;Smedslund, Dalsbø, Steiro, Winsvold, & Clench-Aas, 2007 ). In the
ﬁrst meta-analysis, Babcock et al. (2004) reported a “small” treatment
eﬀect ( d= 0.18) for studies using police reports as the recidivism
outcome. However, they did not publish comparative weighted or un-weighted reo ﬀending rates and their study was not limited to specia-
lized psychological treatment. A limited number of moderators wereexamined showing that, although results did not vary according to
treatment approach (i.e., Duluth vs. CBT), experimental designs were
associated with a slight reduction in treatment e ﬀects. This meta-ana-
lysis was relatively large ( k= 22) but many comparison groups in-
cluded treatment dropouts who hold unique risk characteristics that
impact recidivism ( Hanson et al., 2002; Olver, Stockdale, & Wormith,
2011 ). Two later published meta-analyses have been unable to establish
treatment e ﬀectiveness for specialized domestic violence programs
(Feder & Wilson, 2005; Smedslund et al., 2007 ).Feder and Wilson
(2005) limited their meta-analysis to court-mandated treatment pro-
grams in North America ( k= 10) and found a signi ﬁcant reduction in
domestic violence recidivism for studies using some type of randomi-
zation, but no e ﬀects for those conducted without randomization.
Smedslund et al. (2007) focused their meta-analysis solely on treat-
ments using CBT elements and randomized controlled designs. In this
small meta-analysis of North American studies ( k= 4), Smedslund et al.
concluded that ﬁndings were “inconsistent
 and heterogeneous ”(p. 12).
Given the di ﬃculty researchers have had examining domestic violence
program e ﬀectiveness, it is unsurprising that potential program and
staﬃng moderators have not yet received attention. Further, no meta-
analysis has examined how specialized domestic violence programsmight impact recidivism more generally.
4. Sta ﬀand program variables
Researchers have typically focused on research design as a key
factor hindering knowledge proliferation regarding treatment e ﬀec-
tiveness ( Beech, Freemantle, Power, & Fisher, 2015 ;Dennis et al., 2012;
Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, & Hodgson, 2009 ;Seto et al., 2008; Walton
& Chou, 2015 ). However, variables relating to the program and its
implementation are also important ( Dowden & Andrews, 2004;
Hoberman, 2016 ).
Correctional policy makers experience huge pressures to provide
eﬀective specialized o ﬀense treatments on a large scale at low cost. This
has resulted in a growing reliance on paraprofessionals —rather than
qualiﬁed psychologists —to implement treatment ( Forde, 2017 ;Gannon
& Ward, 2014 ).Gannon and Ward (2014) hypothesized that programs
facilitated by quali ﬁed psychologists should produce optimal outcomes.
Their predictions centered on the premise that fully trained psycholo-
gists hold the level of expertise and associated clinical competencies
necessary to expertly detect and respond to complex client need. Pro-
blems with treatment delivery may well have underpinned the dis-
appointing results from the British Ministry of Justice sexual o ﬀense
program evaluation ( Bullock, Bunce, & Dodds, 2017 ;Mews et al.,
2017 ), since fully quali ﬁed psychologists were rarely involved in hands-
on treatment. Yet, to our knowledge, this variable remains untested.Other sta ﬀvariables such as the provision of facilitator clinical super-
vision ( Bullock et al., 2017) may also impact upon treatment e ﬀec-
tiveness and, as a corollary to Gannon and Ward's predictions, whether
or not supervising sta ﬀhold psychological expertise. However, again,
these variables have not yet been formally tested.
Regarding program variables, meta-analyses show that adherence to
the Risk, Need, and Responsivity (RNR) principles of correctional
treatment ( Andrews & Bonta, 2006, 2010a ) reduce many types of re-
cidivism ( Andrews & Bonta, 2010b ;Babcock et al., 2004 ;Dowden
&
Andrews, 2000; Hanson et al., 2009). For psychological approaches,
CBT appears to generate optimal recidivism reductions ( Hanson et al.,
2002 ;Lösel & Schmucker, 2005 ;Schmucker & Lösel, 2008 ) with the
seeming exception of domestic violence programs ( Babcock et al., 2004;1These are non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc psychological treatments such as cognitive
skills programs.T.A. Gannon, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 73 (2019) 101752
2
Smedslund et al., 2007 ). Other program variables —except for a small
selection investigated in sexual o ﬀending ( Lösel & Schmucker, 2005;
Schmucker & Lösel, 2015) —have received less attention.
5. Meta-analysis need and open science framework preplanned
hypotheses
Previous meta-analyses examining o ﬀense programs have focused
on one single o ﬀense type and have often examined a mixture of spe-
cialized and non-specialized treatments. No previous work has syn-
thesized specialized psychological o ﬀense treatments to examine their
impact on both o ﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism. Our
predeﬁned hypotheses are publicly available via the Open Science
Framework repository ( https://osf.io/euv7t/ ). We predict that in-
dividuals treated with a specialized psychological o ﬀense program (vs.
comparison untreated individuals) will show reduced o ﬀense speci ﬁc
and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism. Based on the extant literature, we
expect the largest recidivism e ﬀects to be associated with sexual o ﬀense
(vs. domestic violence) programs. Previous meta-analyses have not
examined the impact of sta ﬀvariables —in particular quali ﬁed psy-
chological input —as a moderator of recidivism outcomes. We examine
this and predict that specialized psychological o ﬀense treatment fa-
cilitated by psychologists (vs. non-psychologists) will be associatedwith greater reductions in both o ﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc
recidivism. In addition to these key hypotheses, we explore the e ﬀects
of demographic variables, data source variables, treatment sta ﬀ, and
treatment program variables on both o ﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense
speciﬁc recidivism.
6. Method
We report our method in line with the Meta-Analysis Reporting
Standards (MARS), PRISMA ( Moher, Liberati, Tetzla ﬀ,
 & Altman,
2009 ), and with our publicly available Open Science Framework study
plan.
6.1. Study selection
We did not time limit publication or study completion dates when
undertaking searches. However, we did limit searches to articles pub-
lished in English. We electronically searched PsychINFO® , Web of
Science™, ProQuest ®, MEDLINE, Dissertation Abstracts International,
the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the National Criminal Justice
Reference Service, the UK Ministry of Justice, UK Home O ﬃce, Canada
Correctional Services, New Zealand Correctional Services, the UKNational Archives, and the National Police Library (UK). All keyword
combinations used in our searches are available in our Open Science
Framework study plan. We searched publication reference lists and sent
requests to three international Listservs (Association for the Treatment
of Sexual Abusers, Gender-based Research Network, National
Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers) and one national Listserv
(Division of Forensic Psychology Trainees, UK). We also sent individual
e-mails to key researchers identi ﬁed in our search strategy asking them
to identify unpublished data. We concluded the search process on 1February 2018; approximately 12 months following our ﬁrst compu-
terized search.
For inclusion, studies needed to (1) evaluate an o ﬀense speci ﬁc (i.e.,
specialized) psychological treatment provided to adjudicated o ﬀenders,
(2) examine recidivism as an outcome variable, (3) include a compar-
ison group of adjudicated o ﬀenders who did not receive the specialized
treatment in question (or comparable treatment) —and for whom re-
cidivism was also examined, and (4) provide descriptive or inferentialstatistics adequate for e ﬀect size calculation. We excluded studies fo-
cusing on clients under 18 years since these clients have been associatedwith strongest treatment e ﬀects ( Schmucker & Lösel, 2015), clients with
learning disability or other cognitive impairment, or those committedto a mental health facility due to a signi ﬁcant mental disorder.
2We also
excluded drink driving treatment evaluations since these programs areless usual within clinical-forensic settings. Where multiple studies de-
scribed the same treatment outcome data or programme, the manu-
script outlining the highest quality data and typically the largest and
most representative sample was used for analysis.
6.2. Variables
We coded 27 predictor and outcome variables using over 80 cate-
gories. Variables were informed by previous o ﬀending behavior meta-
analyses and research literature gaps. Key variable descriptions are
provided below. For each variable, an unknown category was used to
incorporate information that could not be classi ﬁed using preexisting
categories.
6.3. Predictors
6.3.1. Demographic variables
Age (closest available to time of institutional release); race; gender;
oﬀense type; and sample size N(treatment, comparison).
6.3.2. Data source variables
Year of publication or study completion; country of publication
origin; type of publication (i.e., journal, government report, book
chapter, thesis, presentation, unpublished).
6.3.3. Treatment program variables
Facility setting (prison, community, special facility); therapeutic
community (yes, no); primary treatment method used (CBT, Duluth,
psychoeducation, behavioral, mixed); type of o ﬀense targeted in
treatment (sexual, general violence, family violence); mode of treat-ment provision (group, individual, mixed); treatment format (closed,
rolling); treatment length (hours); treatment site roll out (single site,
multiple sites); polygraph usage (yes, no); treatment quality (Most
promising [uses RNR or evidence based practice], Promising [uses some
RNR or evidence based practice], Weaker [does not use RNR or evi-
dence based practice]). For programs targeting sexual o ﬀending we also
examined whether behavioral conditioning procedures had been usedin an attempt to recondition inappropriate sexual arousal (yes, no).
6.3.4. Treatment sta ﬀvariables
3
Presence of registered autonomous postgraduate psychologist in
hands-on program provision (consistently present [i.e., always], in-
consistently present [i.e., usually/sometimes present], or never pre-
sent); facilitator supervision (yes, no); profession of individual(s) pro-
viding facilitator supervision (registered autonomous postgraduate
psychologist, non-psychologist, or mixed).
6.4. Outcomes
6.4.1. Recidivism variables
Recidivism source (conviction, arrests or charges, institutional re-
cords, uno ﬃcial reports, self-report4); recidivism type (sexual, domestic
violence, and any violence or any general recidivism); recidivism follow
2We did not exclude individuals relocated or committed to mental health
facilities speci ﬁcally to receive treatment for their o ﬀending or o ﬀense relevant
disorder (e.g., pedophilia).
3As outlined in our preregistration document, we also attempted to collect
information on other key program and sta ﬀvariables (e.g., number and type of
staﬀfacilitating treatment). However, we were unable to populate these vari-
ables su ﬃciently for analysis and so we do not describe them.
4If a paper reported multiple recidivism types then we always took the
conviction data since this o ﬀered us the highest level of assurance that a new
oﬀense had been committed.T.A. Gannon, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 73 (2019) 101752

up time (months); and recidivism/non-recidivism sample size ns
(treatment, comparison).
6.4.2. Study quality variables
Matching of the control and treatment participants (yes, no); study
design (randomized or not); and recidivism quality score5(1 = very
low quality [poor data source such as self-report andinadequate follow
up time of one or less years], 2 = low quality [uses either a poor data
source such as self-report orinadequate follow up time of one or less
years but not both], 3 = moderate quality [uses either a moderate datasource such as arrests or charges oradequate follow up time of more
than 1 year], 4 = high quality [uses a moderate data source such asarrests or charges andadequate follow up time of more than 1 year],
5 = very high quality [uses a high quality data source such as nationalconviction data andthree or more years follow up]).
6.5. Study coding protocol and procedure
A coding protocol incorporating all variables described above was
used to code each individual study. Studies were independently doublecoded and cross-checked by Theresa A. Gannon and Jaimee S. Mallion.
Discrepancies stemmed from minor coding oversights and were re-
solved easily through discussion. When information was missing for key
predictor and outcome categories, Theresa A. Gannon used electronic
mail to make contact with either the corresponding manuscript author
or, if that contact was unsuccessful, another co-author. At least two
reminder emails were sent and when contact was unsuccessful, a follow
up phone call was made. We attempted to contact the study author of
all but three articles
6and obtained a response rate of 79% ( n= 53).
Responding authors were not always able to provide all information
requested due to job changes or signi ﬁcant time lapses. Categories were
purposefully merged with other categories when they were underusedprior to hypothesis testing. The ﬁnal coding protocol is available, upon
request, from the ﬁrst author.
6.6. E ﬀect size calculations
Odds Ratios (ORs) were computed for the treatment and comparison
groups, comparing the ratio of recidivists to non-recidivists for each
oﬀense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism type (i.e., sexual
recidivism, domestic violence recidivism, general violence [combinedsexual and nonsexual], or any general recidivism [all recidivism, vio-
lent and nonviolent, as a single outcome variable]). ORs were computed
so that values below 1.0 indicated lower rates of recidivism for treat-
ment, above 1.0 indicated higher rates of recidivism for treatment, and
1.0 indicated zero e ﬀect. We did not include studies that contained
treatment drop-outs in the comparison group due to the higher re-cidivism rates associated with this group (see Lösel & Schmucker, 2005;
Olver et al., 2011 ). Instead, we included all participants originally as-
signed to receive the o ﬀense speci ﬁc treatment in the treatment group
wherever possible (i.e., intent to treat analysis). This is likely to re-present a more conservative test of the e ﬀects of specialized psycho-
logical o ﬀense treatment. All e ﬀect size calculations were electronically
calculated by Mark E. Olver and seven studies (10%) were randomly
selected and hand recalculated by Mark James. Overall, there was
100% agreement across the 13 e ﬀect sizes.
6.7. E ﬀect size aggregation and analyses
ORs were aggregated to generate overall e ﬀect sizes with 95%conﬁdence intervals with both ﬁxed and random e ﬀects models using
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0. A minimum of k= 3 studies was
required to compute a meaningful e ﬀect size. Eﬀ ect size heterogeneity
across studies was examined using the Q test with associated pvalue
(Cochran, 1954 ) and I
2statistic ( Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman,
2003 ). Analyses were conducted including outliers (de ﬁned as extreme
values that contribute approximately 50% or more of the variability in
eﬀect size heterogeneity) and with outliers removed. Moderator vari-
ables were examined through aggregating e ﬀect sizes at di ﬀerent levels
within moderators and examining the di ﬀerence in e ﬀect size magni-
tude for a given moderator to ascertain the e ﬀects of these variables on
recidivism outcomes. Publication bias was examined for each mod-
erator variable that met the criteria for asymmetry testing proposed by
Ioannidis and Trikalinos (2007) . Three sets of asymmetry testing were
conducted: funnel plots of precision, trim and ﬁll (Duval & Tweedie,
2000 ), and fail-safe N(Rosenthal, 1979).
7. Results
AsFig. 1 shows, our searches initially identi ﬁed 6633 articles of
which 68 articles describing 70 studies met the full inclusion criteria.These studies described the recidivism of 55,604 o ﬀenders (22,321
treated, 33,283 comparison) from 70 independent samples. Studies
originated from 39 peer reviewed journal articles, 6 theses/disserta-
tions, 2 poster/presentations, 19 government reports, 1 book chapter,
and 3 unpublished materials. Most studies had been published since
2000 ( k= 43), with some published in the 1990s ( k= 22) and 1980s
(k= 5). Overall, studies were judged to be of reasonable quality with
77.1% ( k= 54) holding a recidivism quality score of high or very high.
Only six studies used a randomized design ( ﬁve examining domestic
violence), and of the remaining studies just under one third ( k= 20)
used an appropriately matched treatment and comparison group (13examining sexual o ﬀense programs, 4 domestic violence programs, and
3 general violence programs). Key variables are shown in Table 1. Open
access data is available from http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/

7.1. O ﬀense speciﬁ c recidivism
Across all program types (i.e., sexual, domestic violence, or general
violence; k=6 2
7), using an average follow up of 66.1 months, o ﬀense
speciﬁc recidivism was signi ﬁcantly lower for individuals who received
specialized treatment relative to those who had not (13.4% [SD = 10.6]
vs. 19.4% [SD = 14.4] respectively; unweighted means) in both the
random (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.57, 0.76) and ﬁxed eﬀect models
(OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.68, 0.76). This represents an absolute decrease
in recidivism of 6% and a relative decrease of 30.9%.
7.2. Sexual oﬀ ending
Table 2 shows meta-analysis results for sexual recidivism. Readers
should note that Mews et al. (2017) was identi ﬁed as an outlier for the
bulk of analyses, featuring an extremely large sample size. For this
reason, we report all ﬁndings with this study removed and included.
Readers should also note that random e ﬀects models are less in ﬂuenced
by outliers than ﬁxed eﬀects models which weight e ﬀect sizes strictly
by sample size; as such, random e ﬀects models were less impacted by
inclusion of Mews et al.
Sexual o ﬀense programs ( k= 44) generated a stable and signi ﬁcant
treatment e ﬀect regardless of whether random (OR = 0.64, 95%
CI = 0.53, 0.76) or ﬁxed eﬀects (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.72)
models were used. Similar to previous meta-analyses, signi ﬁcant

required (e.g., the author speci ﬁed in the article that this information was
unobtainable).7Overall kdoes not equal 70 because not all studies examined o ﬀense speci ﬁc

heterogeneity was present across studies ( Qs= 118.75, p< .001).
Over an average follow up time of 76.2 months (SD = 34.2), sexual
recidivism was 9.5% for treated and 14.1% for untreated individuals
(unweighted means). This represents an absolute decrease in recidivism
of 4.6% and a relative decrease of 32.6%. While the Mews et al. (2017)
evaluation had a limited e ﬀect on the random e ﬀects model, it impacted
theﬁxed eﬀect model, which maintained signi ﬁcant, but smaller, as-
sociations with decreased sexual recidivism. We limit our moderatorcommentary below to key ﬁndings.
7.2.1. Sta ﬀmoderators
Treatment was most e ﬀective in reducing sexual recidivism when a
qualiﬁed licensed psychologist was consistently present in treatment
(vs. inconsistently present, unknown, or not present at all). This e ﬀect
remained when Mews et al. (2017) was included. Receiving supervision
from other sta ﬀwhen facilitating treatment also led to better reductionsin sexual redivism relative to supervision not being provided or its
provision being unknown. This e ﬀect remained when Mews et al. was
included in the random e ﬀects model but reduced in the ﬁxed eﬀects
model. Supervision provided by psychologists held the best associations
with reduced sexual recidivism. A kof 1 for non-psychologist provision
made it impossible to draw adequate comparisons. However, provisionby both psychologists and non psychologists appeared less e ﬀective
(random e ﬀects model) or not e ﬀective ( ﬁxed eﬀects model).
7.2.2. Treatment program moderators
All sexual o ﬀense treatment was CBT. There were larger reductions
in sexual recidivism when treatment service quality was rated as pro-mising or most promising relative to weaker services. The ﬁxed eﬀect
for most promising programs (OR = 1.09) was driven by the singlelarge sample study of Mews et al. (2017) . The association between
program intensity and outcome was not uniform, with treatment e ﬀectsFig. 1. PRISMA Group (2009) ﬂow diagram of article selection. Ψ= psychological.⁎Exclusions of full text articles occurred for multiple reasons and so only the
primary reason is documented here.T.A. Gannon, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 73 (2019) 101752

generally observed across programs of various lengths, although
100–200 h programs (with and without Mews et al.) generated smaller
eﬀects. Treatment across institutions and the community produced
comparable sexual recidivism reductions. When Mews et al. was in-
cluded within institutional settings, however, community programs
generated comparably larger e ﬀects.
Group-based treatment, rather than mixed group and individual
treament, produced the greatest reductions in sexual recidivism except,
again, when Mews et al. (2017) was adjusted for in the ﬁxed eﬀects
model. Relatively larger treatment e ﬀects were observed for programs
that incorporated some form of arousal reconditioning (vs. none or
unknown). Programs that incorporated polygraph use (vs. those that
did not or its use was unknown) produced less convincing recidivism
reductions; the ﬁxed eﬀects model for polygraph absent programs
(OR = 0.96) was driven by Mews et al. Finally, programs provided in
New Zealand or Australia and Canada produced substantial reductions
in sexual recidivism relative to other countries. One in four of these
programs was characterized by consistent psychologist input.
7.2.3. Study quality moderators
With the exception of studies rated fair-moderate ( k< 3) studies
rated as high or very high on recidivism quality were associated with
robust recidivism reductions (OR range 0.61 –0.66). The ﬁxed eﬀects
model with Mews et al. (2017) included was the only exception. Studies
that employed matching criteria produced less superior, yet signi ﬁcant,
reductions in sexual recidivism. Again, the addition of Mews et al. intheﬁxed eﬀects model was the only exception.
7.3. Domestic violence
Domestic violence programs ( k= 14) generated a signi ﬁcant treat-
ment e ﬀect regardless of whether random (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44,
0.97) or ﬁxed eﬀects (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.56, 0.68) models were
used, with signi ﬁcant heterogeneity across studies ( Qs= 72.84,
p< .001). Over an average 62-month follow-up, domestic violence
recidivism was 15.5% (SD = 8.4) for individuals who received treat-
ment and 24.2% (SD = 16.0) for untreated comparisons (unweighted
means). This represents an absolute decrease in recidivism of 8.7% and
a relative decrease of 36.0%.
7.3.1. Sta ﬀmoderators
As shown in Table 3, ks were < 3 for many sta ﬀvariables. Similar
to sexual o ﬀense programs, however, domestic violence treatment ap-
peared most e ﬀective when a quali ﬁed
psychologist was consistently
present (vs. inconsistently present, unknown, or not present at all). The
exception was the ﬁxed eﬀects model for consistant psychologist pre-
sence driven by a single large sample study ( Dutton, Bodnarchuk,
Kropp, Hart, & Oglo ﬀ, 1997 ). Receiving supervision from other sta ﬀ
when facilitating treatment for domestic violence perpetrators also
appeared important in reducing domestic violence recidivism (vs. su-
pervision not being provided or its provision unknown). The relative
eﬀects of various professions providing supervision was unclear, how-
ever, due to the large number of studies for which supervisor professionremained unknown.Table 1

7.3.2. Treatment program moderators
All domestic violence programs were provided in groups, mostly
closed in format ( k= 9), almost exclusively community based ( k= 13),
and of short duration (i.e., < 100 h; k= 13). In addition, none in-
volved therapeutic communities; likely because treatment was largely
community based. Interestingly, the association between program
quality and domestic violence recidivism ran counter to that for sexual
oﬀense programs. The ﬁxed eﬀect for promising programs was driven
by a single large sample study with a positive treatment e ﬀect
(Bloom ﬁeld & Dixon, 2015). However, the random e ﬀects reduced the
impact of this study on the overall e ﬀect. The so-called “weaker ”pro-
grams, which tended to feature education based groups, generated
strong treatment e ﬀects, accounting for large reductions in domestic
violence recidivism (ORs 0.23random, 0.28ﬁxed). CBT treatment
methods did not produce convincing reductions in domestic violence
recidivism. However, the Duluth model —which itself is a pro-feminist
yet also CBT-based program —and psychoeducational models both
produced robust reductions in domestic violence recidivism. Programs
provided in one location, as opposed to multiple locations, were most
eﬀective in reducing domestic violence recidivism.
7.3.3. Study quality moderators
Variations on recidivism quality score were di ﬃcult to interpret due
to small kin the poor and very high categories. However, studies rated
moderate and high were associated with comparably robust reductionsin domestic violence. The random e ﬀects OR for the high category was
driven by Dutton et al. (1997) . Only one study employed matching
criteria making interpretation of this variable di ﬃcult. Since four stu-
dies employed a randomized design, however, we were able to examineORs for studies with and without this feature. Both studies that em-
ployed randomization and studies that did not employ randomization
were associated with robust reductions in domestic violence although
randomization was associated with weaker ORs.
7.4. Violence
Programs targetting general violence comprised only a small sub-
category of studies ( k= 4) and so we could not examine sta ﬀor
treatment program moderators. However, a stable and signi ﬁcant
treatment e ﬀect was found regardless of whether random (OR = 0.60,
95% CI = 0.46, 0.79) or ﬁxed eﬀects (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.79)
models were used with almost negligible study e ﬀect size heterogeneity
(Q= 1.74, ns). Over an average follow up of 25.0 months (SD = 15.1),general violence recidivism was 29.0% for treated and 38.3% for un-
treated individuals (unweighted means; absolute decrease 9.3%; re-
lative decrease 24.3%).
7.5. Non-o ﬀense speciﬁ c recidivism
7.5.1. Any violent recidivism
We examined the overall ability of all specialized programs (i.e.,
sexual, domestic violence, or general violence) to reduce anyform of
violent recidivism, operationalized as a single outcome variable that
included both sexual and nonsexual violence, where this information
was available ( k= 33; see Table 4). Programs produced a signi ﬁcant
reduction in violence in the random (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.68)andﬁxed eﬀects (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.70, 0.79) models with sig-
niﬁcant heterogeneity ( Q= 186.95, p< .001). Across programs, over
an average follow up time of 65.4 months (SD = 35.3), general violence
recidivism was 14.4% for treated and 21.6% for untreated individuals
(unweighted means), corresponding to an absolute decrease in re-
cidivism of 7.2% and relative decrease of 33.3%. When e ﬀects were
disaggregated
across each of the three program types, similar OR
magnitudes were observed, with a little more variation observed for
sexual o ﬀense programs.
7.5.1.1. Sta ﬀ, treatment, and study quality moderators . Consistent with
ﬁndings for o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism, facilitator input from a quali ﬁed
psychologist produced superior reductions in violence relative to
inconsistent psychological facilitator input. It is unclear what
produced the superior ORs noted for the none or unknown category.
Reductions in general violence across programs did not appear to be
substantively impacted by whether sta ﬀsupervision was provided.
However, when psychologists and non-psychologists providedsupervision on the same program, treatment e ﬀectiveness diminished
substantially. Treatment e ﬀects were found across the various levels of
service quality although programs classi ﬁed as most promising were
associated with the best violence reductions, except when Mews et al.
(2017) was entered in the ﬁxed eﬀects model. Treatment e ﬀects were
also found across the various levels of treatment intensity although
programs of lower intensity (< 100 h) appeared slightly less e ﬀective
than higher intensity programs. Treatment that was group-based, ratherthan a mixture of group and individual modalities, produced the
greatest reductions in violent recidivism, except when Mews et al.
was entered into the ﬁxed eﬀects model. Programs administered at one
treatment site also appeared slightly more e ﬀective than treatmentsTable 2 (continued )

administered across multiple sites. For recidivism quality ratings, all
categories were associated with robust recidivism reductions; however,
ratings of very high quality, which included Mews et al. (2017) ,
produced slightly weaker associations with violent recidivism.Similarly, whilst both matched and non-matched designs producednotable reductions in violence recidivism, the weakest associations
were found for matched designs.Table 3

7.6. General (any) recidivism
Thirty-six specialized programs examined general, that is any and
all, recidivism operationalized as a single outcome variable (see
Table 5). These programs signi ﬁcantly reduced general recidivism in
both the random (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.58, 0.76) and ﬁxed eﬀects
(OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.68) models with signi ﬁcant hetero-
geneity ( Q= 132.16, p< .001). Across all program types, over an
average 62.4 month (SD = 35.1) follow-up, any general recidivism was
30.0% for treated individuals and 37.7% for untreated comparisons
(unweighted means), corresponding to absolute and relative recidivism
decreases of 7.7% and 20.4% respectively. Similar OR magnitudes were
observed across the three program types.
7.6.1. Sta ﬀ, treatment, and study quality moderators
Here, ﬁndings did not always mirror those already reported since
treatment e ﬀects did not vary according to the presence of a quali ﬁed
psychologist. However, treatment e ﬀects lessened when supervision
was provided for the same treatment program by both psychologists
and non-psychologists (vs. supervision provided only by psychologists
or non-psychologists). Co-facilitation of programs appeared bene ﬁcial
relative to individually facilitated programs. The promising and mostpromising programs produced the strongest associations with general
recidivism reduction relative to programs rated as weaker. For the most
part, treatments of varying intensity exerted robust treatment e ﬀects
with the exception of the ﬁxed e ﬀect for longer-term treatment
(> 300 h). Programs across all countries exhibited reductions in gen-
eral oﬀending although Canada held the lowest associations. There did
not appear to be a uniform relationship between recidivism qualityscore and reductions in general recidivism. However, matched designs
held slightly lower associations with recidivism reduction.
7.7. Publication bias analyses
We used tests of asymmetry to assess publication bias associated
with the ﬁle drawer problem for all moderating variables that met
Ioannidis and Trikinos' (2007) criteria (see Table 6 ). Thirteen variables
qualiﬁed for testing. When visually inspected, funnel plots showed clear
symmetrical dispersal of e ﬀects sizes around the mean. Based on the
funnel plots, trim and ﬁll tests assign any missing values as required to
create symmetry as well as provide an adjusted overall e ﬀect size. These
analyses are based on the premise that without a publication bias,
studies would show natural sampling error and a symmetrical dis-
tribution of results. The trim and ﬁll test adds studies hypothetically
missing due to publication bias to recreate what an unbiased summaryis likely to look like. As shown in Table 6 , very few variables required
eﬀect sizes to be imputed to obtain symmetry, with the adjusted im-
puted value not substantially di ﬀerent from the observed e ﬀect size.
The fail-safe Nﬁgures
are also impressive, showing that 6– 255 of
missing studies would be needed to diminish signi ﬁcant e ﬀect sizes to
non-signi ﬁcance.8. Discussion
The present meta-analysis is the ﬁrst to review the impact of various
specialized psychological o ﬀense treatments on recidivism. In relation
to our preplanned hypothesis, we found substantially lower recidivism
rates (oﬀ ense speci ﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc) for individuals who
received specialized psychological treatment versus untreated com-parisons, using a sample of > 55,000 individuals. We hypothesized
that the strongest treatment e ﬀects would be found for programs tar-
geting sexual o ﬀending rather than domestic violence; yet surprisingly
we found comparable signi ﬁcant treatment e ﬀects across domestic
violence and sexual o ﬀense programs. Indeed, our meta-analysis is the
ﬁrst to suggest that domestic violence programs produce reductions in
more general o ﬀending and di ﬀers from previously conducted reviews
since we found evidence of a reduction in domestic violence regardless
of whether or not a randomized study design had been used. It is un-
clear why our results regarding domestic violence programs di ﬀer from
the previous literature which presents largely equivocal ﬁndings. Our
meta-analysis di ﬀers from those conducted previously in various ways;
all of which are associated with our inclusion criteria. For example, wefocused only on specialized domestic violence treatment (cf. Babcock
et al., 2004 who included unspeci ﬁed therapy), used intent-to-treat
analyses (cf. Babcock et al., 2004 who used control groups made up of
treatment drop outs), included treatments from various countries (cf.Feder & Wilson, 2005 ;Smedslund et al., 2007 who focused only on
North American studies), and included a range of study designs andtreatment approaches (cf. Smedslund et al., 2007 who focused only on
randomized controlled treatments that contained elements of CBT
8).
Readers should note that our results in relation to the e ﬀects of do-
mestic violence programs on o ﬀense-speci ﬁc recidivism are associated
with the ﬁndings of fourteen studies.
This meta-analysis is also the most exhaustive to date that examines
the eﬀects of specialized psychological treatments for sexual o ﬀending,
including 11 new studies since Schmucker and Lösel's (2015) original
searches in 2010. The sexual recidivism reductions that we found forthese programs were higher than, or at the top end of, those reported in
previous meta-analyses ( Hanson et al., 2002 ;Lösel & Schmucker, 2005;
Schmucker & Lösel, 2015 ). This is especially notable given that this
meta-analysis included the large scale study of Mews et al. (2017)
which has cast signi ﬁcant international doubt on the e ﬀectiveness of
specialized psychological programs for individuals who have sexually
oﬀended ( Forde, 2017). Further, in contrast to the most recent meta-
analysis on sexual o ﬀending ( Schmucker & Lösel, 2015), both prison
and community treatments were associated with reduced recidivism
(see also Hanson et al., 2002; Hanson et al., 2009 ). The non-o ﬀense
speciﬁc recidivism reductions were broadly comparable to those re-
ported previously ( Hanson et al., 2002 ;Lösel & Schmucker, 2005;
Schmucker & Lösel, 2015 ). Finally, our review also showed that general
violence programs ( k= 4) were associated with signi ﬁcant o ﬀense
speciﬁc and non-o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism reductions. This meta-Table 4 (continued )

analytic evidence is the ﬁrst to exclusively focus on o ﬀense speci ﬁc
violence programs suggesting that they are exerting their intended ef-
fects (see also Jolliﬀe & Farrington, 2007 who examined interventions
for violent o ﬀenders more generally).
8.1. Predictors of oﬀ ense speci ﬁc recidivism
8.1.1. Sta ﬀvariables
In line with our preregistered hypothesis, sexual and domestic vio-
lence psychological programs characterized by consistent quali ﬁed
psychologist facilitator input were associated with better outcomes thanprograms without this feature. This supports previous researcher as-
sertions that quali ﬁed psychologists are important for the treatment
success of specialized psychological o ﬀense programs ( Gannon & Ward,
2014 ). Programs that provided clinical supervision for facilitating sta ﬀ
were also associated with better outcomes and variations in outcomeaccording to supervisor profession. For example, for sexual o ﬀense
programs, quali ﬁed psychologist supervisors were associated with su-
perior sexual recidivism reductions. However, the provision of super-
vision by quali ﬁed psychologists andnon-psychologists across the same
program appeared to result in reduced e ﬀectiveness and —in some
cases —ineﬀective treatment. This suggests that psychologists and non-
psychologists o ﬀer guidance that con ﬂicts in some way, resulting in
confused facilitation.
8.1.2. Treatment variables
Our review found that numerous program variables impacted
treatment e ﬀectiveness. The clearest results were associated with sexual
oﬀense programs. Here, predictors associated with the best sexual re-
cidivism reductions were: treatment rated as higher quality; treatments
of shorter (i.e., < 100 h) or longer (i.e., > 200 h) duration; a group-
based treatment format; polygraph absence; and arousal re-
conditioning. The ﬁrst outcome supports previous research indicating
that RNR adherence ( Andrews & Bonta, 2006, 2010b) reduces sexual
recidivism ( Hanson et al., 2009 ). The ﬁndings regarding treatment in-
tensity are harder to interpret, however, since we did not code treat-ment participants according to risk level. The superior e ﬀects for group
only programs may stem from quali ﬁed psychologist faciliators being
consistently present most often in the group only programs ( n=9 ;
75%) relative to the other coded categories for treatment modality(n=
3; 25%). Furthermore, since facilitators knew there were no “mop
up”sessions, this may have forced all critical issues to be discussed
within the group; improving group cohesion which is critical fortreatment e ﬀectiveness ( Beech & Fordham, 1997 ;Burlingame,
McClendon, & Alonso, 2011). Our ﬁndings on this aspect stand in direct
contrast to those of Schmucker and Lösel (2015) , who reported that
programs with more individualized formats (e.g., mixed group andindividual; k= 4) exerted best e ﬀects. Our ﬁndings may di ﬀer simply
because our meta-analysis included more studies in the mixed groupand individual category for comparison ( k= 18).
Polygraph testing and arousal reconditioning had yet to be ex-
aminined in previous treatment meta-analyses, despite widespread use
on many programs ( McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, & Ellerby,
2010 ). Proponants of polygraphy hypothesize that it enables more ef-
fective treatment through ensuring clients adhere to program condi-
tions and provide accurate sexual histories ( Grubin, 2010; Wilcox,
2009 ). The only single-study research available suggests that combining
treatment with the polygraph has little discernable e ﬀect on sexual
recidivism (see McGrath, Cumming, Hoke, & Bonn-Miller, 2007). Our
meta-analytic results are the ﬁrst, however, to suggest that polygraph
use is associated with lower treatment e ﬀect sizes. Although the me-
chanism of this e ﬀect is as yet unclear, we anticipate —as others ha-
ve—that the therapeutic alliance may be negatively impacted when
honesty is formally tested and challenged as part of the treatmentprocess (see McGrath et al., 2010; Meijer, Verschuere, Merckelbach, &
Crombez, 2008). Moreover, the use of arousal reconditioning for ad-dressing inappropriate sexual interests appears to have lost favor in
some jurisdictions (e.g., UK Ministry of Justice; Mews et al., 2017).
Waning enthusiasm may stem from the lack of research examining suchtechniques ( Laws & Marshall, 1991 ;Seto, 2018 ), as well as recent re-
search suggesting that pedophilia represents a sexual preference withbiological origins ( Långström, Babchischin, Fazel, Lichtenstein, &
Frisell, 2015 ). The present ﬁndings, however, are the ﬁrst to report that
programs incorporating active behavioral attempts to restructure and
manage such arousal are associated with larger reductions in sexual
recidivism. Given that inappropriate sexual arousal is a key predictor of
re-oﬀ ending sexually ( Hanson & Morton-Bourgon, 2005),
 thisﬁnding is
particularly pertinent.
Due to relatively small kfor the domestic violence programs, es-
tablishing more deﬁ nitive program predictors of decreased recidivism
and, hence, improved treatment success was more di ﬃcult. However, a
set of key predictors did emerge: treatment rated as lower quality;treatments using the Duluth approach; and treatments that were pro-
vided at a single institution (vs. multiple institutions). Initially it was
unclear why treatments rated as less evidence-based exhibited more
eﬀectiveness. A close examination of program content, however,
showed that they tended to be Duluth or purely psychoeducationalprograms. This suggests that it is the provision of educational in-
formation —that may or may not be rooted in feminism —that is im-
portant for reducing domestic violence, rather than complex psy-chotherapeutic manipulations designed according to “best practice ”
(Edleson & Syers, 1991 ). This may explain why Duluth and psychoe-
ducational approaches produced superior recidivism reductions relative
to CBT (cf. Babcock et al., 2004). However, readers should note theseTable 6

suggestions cautiously since they are just that and are based on rela-
tively small ks. Finally, the superior outcomes associated with treat-
ments administered at a single site suggests that treatments are mosteﬀective when administration is tightly focused.
8.2. Predictors of non-o ﬀense speciﬁ c recidivism
Ourﬁndings for general violent recidivism, across all programs,
showed that quali ﬁed psychologist input, receiving supervision, and the
absence of con ﬂicting psychologist/non-psychologist supervision were
associated with the largest violent recidivism reductions. This mirroredthe sta ﬀeﬀects found for o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism outcomes; how-
ever, similar e ﬀects were not found for general recidivism. It may be
that the e ﬀects of quali ﬁed psychological input, receiving supervision,
and supervisor professions are less visible for general recidivism sincethe content of specialized o ﬀense programs and, by extension, super-
vision are most likely to focus on o ﬀense speci ﬁc—and typically vio-
lent—criminogenic issues. In fact, few program variables emerged as
consistent predictors of non-o ﬀense recidivism and, when they did, they
largely re ﬂected those already targeted for o ﬀense speci ﬁc recidivism.
Theﬁnding that treatment is associated with best results when ad-
ministered at a single site suggests that treatment integrity may be a
critical, yet neglected, factor associated with treatment success more
broadly (see Schmucker & Lösel, 2015).
8.3. Interpretative context
Good meta-analyses should represent a complete and accurate pic-
ture of the overall study population ( Bown & Sutton, 2010; Lipsey &
Wilson, 2001 ). Limiting our searches to documents written in English
may have omitted a small number of studies from our analyses.
Nevertheless, we made every e ﬀort to obtain a full cohort of studies.
Just under half of the documents we obtained (44%) were gatheredfrom materials other than peer reviewed journals and asymmetry tests
illustrated that publication bias was not a concern.
Previous meta-analyses examining specialized o ﬀense treatments
have been critiqued regarding the quality of evaluation studies ex-
amined, with most authors arguing that stronger randomized designs
are required ( Babcock et al., 2004; Hanson et al., 2002; Hanson et al.,
2009 ;Schmucker & Lösel, 2015 ;Walton
& Chou, 2015 ). Our meta-
analysis is no exception to such critique since few studies used a ran-
domized design. However, we did record quality of study design
through examining whether each study employed matching criteria as
well as the overall quality of recidivism variables used within each
study. Using these indicators we were able to show that, with the ex-
ception of domestic violence programs, study design and matching had
surprisingly little impact on recidivism reductions (see also Hanson
et al., 2002 ;Hanson et al., 2009). In fact, since higher recidivism rates
are associated with drop-outs ( Lösel & Schmucker, 2005), our intent-to-
treat meta-analysis is likely to represent a more conservative test of theeﬀects of specialized psychological o ﬀense treatment.
All meta-analyses, including this one, are a ﬀected by potentially
confounded moderator e ﬀects ( Lipsey, 2003 ). Where possible, we ex-
amined the individual studies generating each key moderating e ﬀect for
any obvious patterns of confounding variables.
However, we recognize that numerous unidenti ﬁed confounders
could also be present. A further key limitation was that we did not
always have enough information to populate both an “unknown” and a
“not present ”group for each moderating variable. Whilst this could not
be avoided, it suggests that study authors could improve upon thequality of sta ﬃng and treatment program information provided in
published and unpublished reports. We know, for example, that manycompetent professionals (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists) would not
have been classi ﬁed as independent registered psychologists. However,
information was simply not available to conduct coding and analysesbased on facilitator profession. We suggest authors clearly report eachof the program and sta ﬀvariables outlined in Tables 2 and 3 in all
future evaluations as an absolute minimum.
8.4. Future policy and practice directions
The outcomes of this meta-analysis are the ﬁrst to suggest that
specialized psychological programs that target various o ﬀending be-
haviors are e ﬀective. Although there was signi ﬁcant heterogeneity
across the outcomes of individual studies, our review suggests ways that
policy makers and program providers might optimize program out-
comes. First, the results indicate that program developers should pro-
vide quali ﬁed psychologists who are consistently present in hands-on
treatment; and second, facilitators should be provided with supervisionopportunities that are similar across the program. Interestingly, less
than one in ﬁve programs consistently used quali ﬁed psychologists in
hands-on facilitation and the majority of these (83.3%; n= 10) were
implemented in the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s rather than more recently.
The provision of supervision was more evenly spread. We recognize the
signiﬁcant pressures that policy makers face providing cost e ﬀective
programs to large numbers of individuals ( Gannon & Ward, 2014 ).
 As
an indication of this, correctional systems in a number of international
jurisdictions have been moving away from the direct involvement of
psychologists as treatment providers, with therapeutic activities such as
running manual-based groups being delegated to correctional program
oﬃcers who may have little or no formal clinical training. Ironically, it
seems that this variable is correlated with optimum behavioral changeand yet quali ﬁed psychologist hands-on input is lacking in programs
implemented in recent years. This may explain why we did not ﬁnd
more modern treatments to bring about improved outcomes (see also
Lösel & Schmucker, 2005 ). Quali ﬁed psychological sta ﬀand regular
supervision come at a clear ﬁnancial cost. Program providers could
consider the bene ﬁts of pruning down sta ﬀfacilitation numbers as a
compensatory ﬁnancial strategy given that individual and co-facilitated
programs seem to be equally bene ﬁcial. Program providers might also
want to consider methods for tightly controlling program im-
plementation given that we found single site treatments seemed to fare
better than multisite treatments.
Further o ﬀense speci ﬁc practice implications are available for those
involved in sexual o ﬀense and domestic violence policy. Regarding
sexual o ﬀense programming, the results indicate that best practice
guidelines in this area should be revised to include (1) cautionary
messages regarding polygraph use within the therapeutic context, and
(2) further commentary on —and expansion of —the evidence base
around behavioral reconditioning as a treatment tool. Those taskedwith developing and managing programs for those who have been
domestically violent should seek out the best educational materials
possible and consider how such materials can be skilfully woven into
program facilitation to produce optimal results.
9. Conclusions
Previous researchers have noted that it is di ﬃcult to ascertain the
exact variables responsible for apparent recidivism reductions when
engaging in large scale meta-analytic work ( Hanson et al., 2002 ); we
agree, particularly when heterogeneity of ﬁndings is present across
studies. However, the ﬁndings from this review across traditional and
emerging specialized psychological o ﬀense programs presents conver-
ging evidence that such programs impact a broad range of o ﬀending
behaviors in addition to impressive reductions in o ﬀense speci ﬁc re-
cidivism. Amidst these ﬁndings, however, lies an important moderating
variable that has been neglected in previous meta-analyses: programstaﬃng. If specialized psychological o ﬀense programs are to be e ﬀec-
tive, then our review suggests that researchers and clinicians mustseriously consider these factors in addition to study
 design quality.T.A. Gannon, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 73 (2019) 101752

Abstract 
Inmates who had enrolled in most of educational programme while incarcerated had lower recidivism rates than 
those who did not attend the programme. Inmates need edu cation programme that not only teach them to read and 
write but also provide them with the necessary skills that promote a positive transition to society when they are 
released. Efforts in this direction would help promote better participation of inmates in all prison education 
programmes and will go along away to help the prisoner rehabilitation processes. This paper focus on how 
Vocational education and training reduces recidivism.

1.1. Introduction 
The aim of establishing prison institutions all over the wo rld is to provide a rehabilitation and correctional facility 
for the convict there by providing an effective environmen t that reduces the risk of reoffending. Many offenders 
have education and skills levels below average standard  are more likely to be unemployed who has an impact on 
their health and ability to find housing. 
 
1.2. Vocational education and training 
The introduction of vocational education and training as pa rt of the prisoner rehabilitation offers opportunities for 
offenders to increase the likely hood of successful reintegration in to the community and reducing the risk of reoffending(2). Providing offenders with Vocational education and training will provide significant benefit in 
addressing issues that caused offences as well as reduces their recidivism rate. 
Offender’s lack of educational attainment negatively has impacts on their employment prospect which also 
negatively has effect on their physical and mental issues. Providing motivated offenders the opportunity to educate themselves, the offender’s life can impr ove through the experiences of discipli ne, instilling confidence and stability 
(11). 
According to (17), meta-analysis was conducted to ex amine the association between vocational education and 
training and reduction in recidivism, improvement in employment after release from prison. The findings support the premise that receiving correction education while inca rceration reduces individuals risks of recidivism. They 
researchers also found that those receiving Vocational education and training had improved odds of obtaining employment after release, the findings include: correctiona l education improves chances of not returning to prison, 
inmates who participated in correctional education programmed had 43% lower odds of recidivism than those who did not participate. This translates to a reduction in the risk of recidivism of 13%, providing correctional education 
can be cost effective when it comes to reducing recidivism. 
A Queensland study, based on over 1,800 people who returned to custody within three years was undertaken of 
the links between prisoner’s participation in Vocationa l training programmed and their chances of returning to 
prison. It found that 32 percent of prisoners who did not participate in vocational training programed before their initial release returned to custody within two years wh ile only 23 percent of vocational training programed 
participants returned (2). 
Recidivism : habitual offending, an act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after he has either 
experienced negative consequences of that behavior. It is also used to refer to percentage of prisoners who are re-
arrested for a similar offence (12). 
Vocational Training: refers to a training which equips trai nees with the process of manipulative skills in a chosen 
occupation (14).  (15) Defines vocational education as ‘’any form of education whose primary purpose is to prepare 
persons for employment in recognized occupations’’. That is  to say vocational education provides skills, knowledge, 
and attitudes necessary for effective employment in specific occupations.  
Vocational education can be conceived as  a comprehensive term referring to those aspects of educational process 
involving, in addition to general ed ucation, the acquisition of practical skills, attitudes, understanding, and 
knowledge relating to occupations in various sectors of economic and social life (6)   
 
1.3. Benefits of vocational education and training in prison  
 
Studies have address why vocational education and trai ning programmed are successful for reducing recidivism 
rates and improving opportunity for (13). Discussion focus on two main important reasons: first training increases 
the amount of human capital that a parolee can offer potentia l employees, and second that earning a certificate in 
any field ‘’signals’’ to potential employers a seriousness that compensates in part for the stigma of a criminal record 
(7) 
274   Hadi Mohammed and Wan Azlinda Wan Mohamed  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   204  ( 2015 )  272 – 276 
 
• Human capital : investment in human capital is probably the most common cited reason for assigning 
inmate to a vocational education and training. Theo rist about human capital emphasize that a trained 
worker is worth more to the employer as an employee than one who is not trained or skilled. The role of 
education for creating human capital is explicitly addr ess in the vocational edu cation curricular evaluated 
here by an insistence that a rigorous range of literacy, general education/ employability skills, hands on and technical skills be part of the courses (7) 
The insistence is important because potential employees who have mastered particular skills are more        valuable to employers, are more likely to be hired, are more likely to generate profits from companies and 
are likely to generate good wages for the employee. Skilled employees bring to an employer ‘’human 
capital ‘’ that people without such training do not have  in a good terms of knowledge and skill level.  
Notably such skills include basic protocols needed  in a good employee such as punctuality, co -
cooperativeness, timeliness and team-work. 
 
• Certification:  certification and criminal records are sometimes referred to in labour market as ‘’signal’’ 
(8). Licenses, certificates and other documents signal to potential employees that a potential employee likely has specific skills, interests and commitment to a profession whereas others may not.  Possession of a nationally recognized certification helps overcome the stigma of a criminal record. Formal certification 
as part of an education programed in prison is particularly important. 
 
1.4 How vocational education reduces recidivism 
 
Vocational education and training reduces recidivism ra tes by providing inmates with the technical skills, 
literacy and numeracy courses, as well as motivation and employment opportunity: 
 
• Technical skills: prisoners believed that as well as providing technical skills, the courses also improved 
their communication and organizational skills, all of wh ich would help find employment and reintegrate in 
to the community upon release. A technical skill is a skill that is required for the accomplishment of a 
specific task (21).  Barriers to undertaking or comple ting vocational training cour ses include the need for 
prisoner to undertake offending behaviour programed and desire to earn money through paid prison work. 
Other factors were short sentences (under 12 months) and long waiting lists of courses, being transferred to 
another centre without much more notice or being release early. 
 
• Literacy and numeracy : the educational programme offer literacy and numeracy courses as well as 
higher-level qualifications such as Vocational training Diplomas. The completion rate was found to be over 80 percent. The high completion rate was attributed to: undertaking a risk assessment and looking at the sentence management plan to determine the educa tional and vocational training needs of offenders, 
offering the courses as modules, having dedicated training workshops, promoting the employment 
opportunities provided by the training, recognizing the achievements of trainees who completed the 
course. 
 
• Motivation:  Another factor that will determine an offender’s recidivism is the motivation for the offender 
to change (7).Argued that the analysis of former of fenders indicated that their decision to change was a 
significant factor in them not re-offending. Offend ers with no motivation had fatalistic and respondent 
attitudes towards their criminality whereas motivated offenders were able to identify and make sense of 
their criminality.   
  (7) Argues that for some offenders, the motivation to change may need to include the severing of negative 
social bonds, as he argues that this may have been a factor in their original offending (1). describes offender’s 
motivation to change as being instrumental in improving an  offender’s mental health as they are more focused on 
goals and resilient to negative external and social impacts in their lives. 
In order for Technical and vocational education to benefit the offender, it is important for it to be tailored 
and focused on the needs of the offender; an example of this is the needs surrounding female offenders. Gordon and 
275  Hadi Mohammed and Wan Azlinda Wan Mohamed  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   204  ( 2015 )  272 – 276 
Weldon (9), Argues that issues surrounding female offenders are compounded by other issues that can include being 
single percent family rejection, history of physical or sexual abuse as well as a high prevalence of mental health issues. 
A female offender’s history of physical and sexual abuse is an issue that will regulate training and 
education programed to be specifically tailored towards them  for optimal effectiveness.  Olaitan (14) trainers and 
educators will need to present their programmed in a manner that is inclusive, fair and consistent.  
 
• Employment opportunity:  (17), describes how training and education offered to offenders needs to be 
relevant to employment opportunities that exist in the location that the offender lives and is likely to be employed in. An example of this is for offenders in areas with high tourism, hospitality courses would be 
the focus likewise, and vocational training in rural areas would focus on agriculture and forestry 
.    
Preparing offenders for employment through vocational education and training alone may not be enough to get them 
in to the employment market (16), describe how offender s, especially those who have been incarcerated, may have 
significant issues that inhibit their ability to find employment. These may include lack of recent employment experiences, being excluded from certain types of employme nt, as well as the potential to weaken social connections 
that may lead to employment. 
Poor educational attainment coupled with poor employment record prospects on an offender’s mental health (9), indicates that 36% of male police detainee and 53% of female police detainees reported either being diagnosed with a mental or being treated for a mental illness. (3), describe how 01 percent of male of male offenders in prison present symptoms of depression, while 25 percent suffer major depression.  (9) Describes how many offenders with mental health issues may have strained issue 
relations with their families and friends. This may leave them alone coping with factors that may include inadequate 
employment and housing, money management issues as well as medication management. Offenders benefit from training and education from improvement to their mental health.  (5) Describes how offenders who participate in 
education programmes illustrate positive psychological traits that include self-reliance, autonomy and independence.  
A study in Australian institute of criminology (1) data illustrate that while those with low level of educational attainment have a higher probability of becoming a police de tainee, those with higher edu cational attainment have a 
lower probability of becoming a police detainee. This is high lighted by the fact that while 40 percent of male police 
detainees and 51percent of female police detainee had completed ten years or less. The number of male and female police detainees more than halved had completed 11or 12 years. For those who completed university, the level of female police detainees was five percent while male police detainees were at four percent. 
However while low educational standards are of great concern of particular role is the fact that many 
offenders lack even the basic fundamentals of educati on such as literacy skills. Offenders who participate in 
vocational training and education have lower recidivism ra tes than offenders who do not participate (9), argue that 
those offenders who participated in prison education programm e had recidivism rate at four percent. This is contrast 
to 65 percent recidivism rate for those who did not participate in prison education programme 
.  
Offenders benefit from training and education from improvement to cognitive functioning and job prospects.   (4) 
State that cognitive strategy that is the ability of individu als to analytically interpret information and enhanced the 
more the individuals is prepared to further their educatio n. Higher cognitive functioning is of great importance in 
relation to individuals adapting to higher education and the workplace. As offenders prepare themselves to step back 
in to his or her community, they search within for a renewed sense of self image and plan to stay clear of criminal behaviour. It has been implied that offenders returning to the community unprepared and uneducated results in bitter 
individuals that could be a further threat to public safety and increase recidivism rates which are costly. 
 
  Recommendations  
 
  Prison institutions should be prov ided with all the facilities needed for vocational education and training thus; 
standard workshops, modern facilities and as well improved remuneration for all the stake holders. There should be 
regular evaluation of the programed to determine the strength and weakness of the programed. Non-governmental 
organization should be involved in funding and superv ising the programed. All trained inmates should be 
automatically employed either in public or cooperate bodies after released. No stigmatization for the ex-convicts in 
276   Hadi Mohammed and Wan Azlinda Wan Mohamed  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   204  ( 2015 )  272 – 276 
the society should be allowed. They should be fully re -integrated, be certified in accordance with the National 
Vocational Qualification guide.   
 
Conclusion   Vocational education and training as part of the prisoner rehabilitation offers opportunities for offenders to increase 
the likely hood of successful re-integration in to the community and reducing the risk of re-offending. TVE will 
provide significant benefit in addressing issues that caused offences as well as reduces their recidivism rate. 
Therefore providing inmates with vocational educat ion and training is pathway to reduce recidivism

The Effects of Vocational 
Education on Recidivism and Employment Among Individuals Released Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Susan McNeeley1
Abstract
Prior research shows employment is an important component of desistance, but there is mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of prison-based education programs. Therefore, this study examines whether participation in vocational education programs while incarcerated improves recidivism and post-release employment outcomes. In addition, the study controls for the timing of release to examine whether recidivism and employment outcomes varied during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observable selection bias was reduced by using propensity score matching to create similar treatment and comparison groups. After matching, there were no differences in any outcome between those who obtained vocational certificates and the comparison group. The results demonstrate the importance of accounting for selection bias in evaluations of education and employment programs. It is recommended that career-focused educational programs incorporate the risk-needs-responsivity model and the continuum of care principle, build relationships with community employers, and assist with practical barriers to employment.

Introduction
The literature on reentry to the community after release from prison confirms that 
recidivism is lower among those who find stable, high-quality employment (Berg & Huebner, 2011; La Vigne et al., 2004; Lockwood et al., 2012; Uggen, 2000; Verweij et al., 2021; Visher & Courtney, 2007; Visher et al., 2011). The relationship between employment and desistance is especially salient when individuals work in “career jobs” rather than “survival jobs” (Bucklen & Zajac, 2009; Niebuhr & Orrick, 2020; Uggen, 1999) . Despite the importance of obtaining employment soon after release from prison, releasees face difficulty in finding work (Uggen & Staff, 2001; Visher & Courtney, 2007) . Those who have been incarcerated are often not well educated and lack job training and vocational skills (Coates, 2016; Duwe, 2018a; Petersilia, 2003; Visher et al., 2011); importantly, many incarcerated people are released with similar educational and vocational deficits as they had when they were incarcerated (Crayton & Neusteter, 2008; Solomon et al., 2004). Given the importance of education for obtaining employment, prison-based education and career training may be a key com-ponent of successful reentry.
Accordingly, many correctional agencies have implemented programs that focus on 
education and vocational training, with a handful of single studies that examined such programs showing some success (see Clark, 2015; Davis et al., 2013; Drake et al., 2009; Duwe, 2015a, 2015b; Duwe & Clark, 2014, 2017; Duwe & McNeeley, 2020; McNeeley, 2018, 2022; Saylor & Gaes, 1992; Towne et al., 2022). However, other evaluations of employment programming among justice-involved people have shown null results (Cook et al., 2015; Northcutt Bohmert & Duwe, 2012) . More notably, systematic reviews (Newton et al., 2018; Nur & Nguyen, 2022; Visher et al., 2005) found no reduction in recidivism or increase in employment. These authors suggest that program inconsistency and methodological issues render it difficult to determine at this time whether vocational programming improves post-release outcomes. Much of the past work on educational programming has examined career-focused education alongside other education or other vocational programs. As a result, the unique effect of vocational education on reentry success is not well understood.
Importantly, there have been few evaluations that correct for differences in those 
who self-select into educational programming. Prior research suggests program par -
ticipation varies by a number of personal characteristics such as gender, age, time served, criminal history, offense type prison visitation, other treatment participation (e.g., Butler et al., 2022; Duwe, 2015a; McNeeley, 2021, 2022). However, only a handful of studies have attempted to account for self-selection (see Jonas-van Dijk et al., 2020). A review of experimental research on employment-focused programs sug-gested the overall link between employment and recidivism may be a result of selec-tion into employment by a subgroup of highly motivated individuals (Muhlhausen, 2015).
Therefore, this study uses propensity score matching (PSM) to account for observ-
able selection bias before examining recidivism and employment outcomes for those who obtained vocational certificates, diplomas, or licenses while incarcerated. In

particular, the study examines individuals released from Minnesota state prisons 
between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Given the disruption in the job mar -
ket (e.g., Petrosky-Nadeau & Valletta, 2020; Sahin et al., 2020) and potential changes to policing and community corrections (e.g., Ashby, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020; Viglione et al., 2020) that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to assess the extent to which vocational programs may have assisted releasees in obtain-ing employment and/or desisting from crime during the pandemic. By accounting for changes in recidivism and employment outcomes due to the pandemic, the results will inform future research examining post-release outcomes during this time period.
Vocational Programming in Minnesota
V ocational programs are offered in all Minnesota Department of Corrections (MnDOC) facilities. These programs result in post-secondary certificates or diplomas that are industry-recognized and certified. For example, the National Center for Construction Education and Research certifies the Cabinetry, Cabinet Making, Dry Wall, and Painting/Decorating programs, while the Minnesota Board of Cosmetologist Examiners and the Minnesota Barber Board awards licenses to graduates of the Cosmetology and Barber programs. As there is a need to address “soft skills” related to employment, all vocational programs include Career and Employability Skills train-ing. All instructors hold up-to-date credentials issued by the Minnesota Correctional Education Center (MCEC). In 2018, 578 individuals obtained a vocational certificate, diploma, or license (MnDOC, 2019).
V ocational programs are post-secondary, in that incarcerated people are required to 
have a high school diploma or GED prior to enrollment. Further eligibility is deter -
mined on a case-by-case basis by considering an individual’s educational achieve-ment, facility discipline, work history, employability after release, and other relevant factors. Priority is given to those with less than 5 years of incarceration remaining on 
their sentence, both due to limited resources and because programming is most suc-cessful when completion occurs closer to release from prison (Duwe, 2018b).
Research Methods
Data and Sample
This study used a retrospective quasi-experimental design to test whether vocational 
education improved recidivism and employment outcomes. Specifically, completers released from prison between 2019 and 2020 were compared to a matched comparison group of non-participants released during the same time period. When an individual was released more than once during that period, only their first release was examined. A total of 928 individuals who completed vocational programs were released in 2019 or 2020. Because of limited resources as well as a lack of hard eligibility criteria that can be used to reduce the comparison pool, 6,941 non-participants who were released between 2019 and 2020 would have been eligible for vocational education.

Pre-incarceration employment data were not available; therefore, the Level of Service/
Case Management Inventory (LSCMI) education/employment domain score was used as a proxy to control for employment history. However, some incarcerated people did not receive an assessment before their release. After excluding those with missing LSCMI data, there were 6,711 individuals in the sample, including 706 vocational program completers and 6,005 who were eligible but did not participate.
Dependent Variables
Recidivism was measured as a (1) rearrest, (2) reconviction, (3) reincarceration in an MCF for a new offense, and (4) revocation of supervised release following an indi-vidual’s first release from prison. Rearrest and reconviction data were obtained from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, while reincarceration and revocation data were obtained from the Correctional Operations Management System maintained by MnDOC. The study tracked recidivism through January 31, 2022, resulting in a fol-low-up period between 1 and 3 years. Data on post-release employment were obtained 
from the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development (DEED). Post-release employment was measured four different ways: a binary measure of whether releasees obtained employment after their release from prison, the total num-ber of hours an individual was employed following their release from prison, the total wages reported during their period of time in the community after they were released from prison, and their hourly wages. While it would be of interest to determine whether individuals obtained jobs that fit the career or vocation they studied, we were unfortu-nately unable to examine this using the DEED data.
Independent Variables
The independent variable of interest compared individuals who obtained vocational certificates, diplomas, or licenses while incarcerated with those who were eligible but did not complete such programming. Participation in vocational programs was mea-sured as “1” for participants and as “0” for non-participants.
The following control variables were included in the analyses: LSCMI, LSCMI 
education and employment domain score, gender,
1 race/ethnicity, age at release, mari-
tal status, county of commitment, number of prior convictions, number of prior super -
vision failures, number of institutional discipline convictions, number of visits received, length of stay in months, offense type (person, sexual, drug, property, DWI, or other), number of other prison-based programs the individual participated in, and type of post-release supervision (standard supervision, intensive supervision, early release program such as work release or the Challenge Incarceration Program (see Duwe & Kerschner, 2008), or discharge with no supervision). Finally, the study con-trolled for whether the individual was released during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was operationalized using the date that the governor declared a peacetime emergency, which allowed the state government to pass public health measures in an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (March 13, 2020).

Propensity Score Matching
PSM is often used in program evaluations to help achieve balance between treatment 
and control groups and account for observable selection bias. PSM estimates the con-ditional probability of selection to a treatment based on observed covariates (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1985) . These estimates, known as “propensity scores,” are created through a logistic regression model predicting program completion. Propensity scores are then used to match those who entered treatment with similar individuals who did not. Table 1 presents the logistic regression model predicting vocational pro-gram completion. Consistent with prior research on self-selection (e.g., Butler et al., 2022; Duwe, 2015a; McNeeley, 2021, 2022), several of the control variables were significantly related to completing a vocational certificate or diploma. Completion was more likely among White (b = −0.131, p < .01) and younger individuals 
(b = −0.012, p < .001), those with more prior convictions (b = 0.007, p < .001), those 
committed for release violations (b = −0.329, p < .001), those who had been in prison 
longer (b = 0.008, p < .001), those who completed other treatment programs (b = 0.091, 
p < .01), and those who received more visits (b = 0.001, p < .001).
After obtaining propensity scores on the 6,711 individuals included in the propen-
sity score model, participants were matched within a caliper (i.e., range of propensity scores) of 0.01 using a “greedy” matching procedure with a without-replacement method. Matches were obtained for 652 vocational participants, resulting in a final sample of 1,304. Table 2 presents the degree to which PSM reduced observable selec-tion bias. The bias measure shown in the table represents the standardized mean differ -
ence between the treatment and comparison groups. Bias values over 20 are considered unbalanced (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1985). Before matching there were three unbal-anced covariates based on the bias value (length of stay, number of effective programs completed, and visitation); six additional covariates showed significantly different means based on the t-test provided in Table 2 (gender, LSCMI and LSCMI education/employment domain, property offense, new commitment, and discipline). After matching, all the covariates for the matched sample had bias values below 20 and non-significant t-values.
Analysis Plan
Cox regression was used to analyze recidivism. Cox regression utilizes time-depen-dent data, which are important in determining not only whether people recidivate, but also when they recidivate. Cox regression uses both “status” and “time” variables to estimate the impact of the independent variables on recidivism. The “status” variable measures whether or not the individual was rearrested, reconvicted, reincarcerated, or returned to prison following a revocation of supervised release. The “time” variable measures the amount of time from the date of release until (1) the date of the first recidivism event, (2) January 31, 2022, for those who did not recidivate, or (3) their date of death, for those who did not recidivate and were known to have died before the end of the follow-up period. The DEED data do not provide the dates when people

Table 3 shows the rates of recidivism and finding employment, as well as average 
hours worked, hourly wages, and total wages, for the treatment and comparison groups. When comparing the unmatched sample, individuals who obtained vocational certificates, diplomas, or licenses fared significantly better on rearrest and reconvic-tion as well as all four employment outcomes, although there was no difference in returns to prison for either a new felony sentence or a supervised release revocation. However, when comparing the matched groups, vocational completers had somewhat lower rates of recidivism, a somewhat higher rate of employment, and somewhat higher averages for hours worked and wages—but only one of these differences was statistically significant. Individuals who obtained vocational certificates or diplomas had average hourly wages that were about $1.20 higher than those in the matched comparison group (t = 2.053, p < .05).
To control for factors associated with release from prison as well as account for 
how quickly after release an individual recidivated, multivariate Cox regression mod-els predicting recidivism are presented in Table 4. None of the types of recidivism examined here were significantly related to vocational education completion. However, the results show release type was significantly related to recidivism. Compared to those on standard supervision, individuals participating in an early release program were 33% less likely to rearrested and 42% less likely to be reconvicted, but 77% more likely to have their supervised release revoked. Those released on intensive supervi-sion were 28% more likely to be rearrested and nearly three times more likely to return to prison due to a revocation of supervised release. Those discharged with no supervi-sion were about twice as likely to be rearrested, 93% more likely to be reconvicted, and about 2.5 times more likely to be reincarcerated for a new offense than were those released on standard supervision. Finally, those released during the COVID-19 Table 3. Recidivism and Employment Outcomes by Vocational Completion.

pandemic were 24% less likely to be rearrested and 41% less likely to return to prison 
due to supervised release revocation than those released before the pandemic.
Table 5 shows multivariate results for the employment outcomes. The first column 
presents the logistic regression model predicting employment in the first year after release. Those who completed vocational programs were not significantly more or less likely to obtain employment. The other three columns present GLMs predicting total hours worked, average hourly wage, and total wages earned in the first year after release from prison. None of these outcomes were significantly related to vocational program completion. Release type was significantly related to employment outcomes; compared to those on standard supervision, those participating in early release pro-grams were about four times more likely to be employed, those on ISR were 57% more likely to be employed, and those discharged with no supervision were 47% less likely to be employed. Total hours worked, hourly wage, and total wages earned were all higher among those participating in early release programs and lower among those discharged with no supervision. Finally, those released during the COVID-19 pan-demic were 32% less likely to obtain employment in the first year after release from prison than those released before the pandemic, but were not significantly different in terms of hours worked or wages earned.
To check whether the results presented above were an artifact of different outcomes 
across different vocational programs, programs were categorized into the following groups: barbering and cosmetology, construction (cabinetmaking, carpentry, drywall installation, floor covering, masonry, painting and decorating, and welding), manufac-turing (heavy equipment operator, machine tool technology, manufacturing skills, and print production), mechanical design and drafting, business management, and com-puter careers. The supplemental analyses presented in Table 6 compare individuals who completed each type of program to the comparison group of non-completers, with individuals who completed other types of programs excluded. These models included all control variables; however, to ease presentation, the table only shows the results for program completion. Only two significant results were found. First, those who com-pleted programming in Computer Careers were 35% less likely to experience super -
vised release revocation than the comparison group (p < .05). Second, those who Table 4. Cox Regression Models Predicting Recidivism.

than those who did not complete any vocational programming (b = 0.69, p < .05).
Finally, supplemental analyses (available upon request) separately examined mod-
els among those released before the COVID-19 pandemic and among those released during the pandemic. The null relationships between vocational programming and the recidivism and employment outcomes were observed for those released during both time periods.
Discussion
This study examined whether completing vocational education programs while in prison improves recidivism or employment outcomes after release from prison. Two specific programs showed very limited success: those who studied computer careers were less likely to return to prison due to a violation of supervised release and those who studied mechanical design and drafting had higher hourly wages. But overall, after using propensity score matching to create a similar comparison group, vocational education was not related to better outcomes in terms of either recidivism or employ-ment. The results demonstrate the importance of accounting for selection bias when evaluating education and employment programs (see Muhlhausen, 2015). The com-parison of the unmatched treatment and comparison groups showed that people who completed vocational programs fared better. However, when comparing completers to a similar control group—as was done after matching—there were no significant differ -
ence in several outcomes measuring employment and recidivism. It is possible that those who complete vocational education tend to be highly motivated individuals who could have fared well without these programs.
The lack of significant findings after matching is perhaps not surprising given the 
results from Table 2 showed individuals who selected into vocational training were distinct from those who did not in ways that are known to be related to better out-comes. For example, they had lower risk for recidivism based on the LSCMI, had Table 5. Logistic Regression Model and GLM Predicting Employment Outcomes.

lower education/employment needs, were more likely to complete other treatment pro-
grams, and were more likely to receive visits. According to the risk-needs-responsivity model (Andrews et al., 1990, 2006; Lowenkamp et al., 2006), greater recidivism-reducing benefits could be observed if recruitment efforts were targeted toward those with the highest risk of recidivism who also have high employment and education needs. At the same time, education and employment are considered a moderate crimi-nogenic need rather than one of the “Big Four” (Andrews & Bonta, 2010); as such, individuals who have more pressing criminogenic needs such as anti-social attitudes should be encouraged to prioritize programming that addresses those above education or employment programming (see Latessa, 2011). Similarly, individuals with high education needs may need to prioritize more basic education programming.
Additionally, it is possible that learning a job skill or obtaining a license in a par -
ticular field while incarcerated may not be sufficient to help formerly-incarcerated people when reentering the community. First, correctional programs are most success-ful when they establish a continuum of care in which participation begins in the facil-ity and continues into the community (Miller & Miller, 2010; Ndrecka, 2014; Pullman et al., 2006). Second, this type of programming may not address some of the issues that lead to difficulty with employment after release from prison. Employment pro-grams likely have greater effects on reentry if they address other aspects of obtaining employment, such as resume writing, interview skills, and attitudes unfavorable toward employment (Duwe & Clark, 2017; Varghese, 2013; Varghese et al., 2021), as well as practical barriers to employment such as transportation, supplies, and inter -
view-appropriate clothing (McNeeley, 2022). Third, some successful employment programs—such as Minnesota’s EMPLOY (see Duwe, 2015b; McNeeley, 2022)—actively work to connect formerly-incarcerated people in the program with potential employers willing to hire individuals with criminal histories.
Importantly, the study also suggests some outcomes differed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Those who were released during the pandemic were less likely to be rear -
rested and experience supervised release revocation than those who were released in the year or so before the start of the pandemic. Societal changes due to the pandemic may have reduced opportunity for criminal or otherwise antisocial behavior. At both the individual and community level, crime is lower when people spend less unstruc-tured leisure time outside the home (Cohen & Felson, 1979; Osgood & Anderson, 2004); consistently, crime reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed in several US cities (Abrams, 2021; Ashby, 2020; Campadelli et al., 2020; Mohler et al., 2020). On the other hand, changes in criminal justice operations could also explain these results; police limited proactive and reactive activities which often lead to arrests during the pandemic (Ashby, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020). Community corrections prac-tices also changed dramatically during the pandemic, with some agencies no longer meeting with all clients, some agencies reporting a lower frequency of meetings, and most agencies processing fewer violations for noncompliant behavior (e.g., Viglione et al., 2020). Unfortunately, this study could not differentiate between these possible mechanisms.
McNeeley 13
The results also showed lower rates of post-release employment during the COVID-
19 pandemic. This was expected due to the disruption in the service and retail indus-
tries that occurred during the pandemic (Suneson, 2020), as these are industries that often employ formerly-incarcerated people (e.g., Nally et al., 2014). In addition, some individuals may have chosen not to work in order to avoid exposure to COVID-19, especially if they or their loved ones had health concerns that made them vulnerable. Employment outcomes for individuals released from prison may have improved once vaccination became possible as well as when restrictions were lifted. Scholars inter -
ested in reentry should continue to examine specific barriers to reentry that returning individuals experienced during the pandemic and continue to experience as the pan-demic evolves.
Some limitations of the study must be noted. First, some of the careers covered in 
these programs (such as barbers and cosmetologists, construction-related work) may lend themselves to under the table work, working as an independent contractor, or becoming self-employed. In these cases, their employment may not have been reported to DEED through the unemployment insurance program. Therefore, individuals in the sample could have been engaged in legitimate work but not represented in the DEED employment data examined here, and it is possible this could be more likely among those who completed programming. Second, this study was unable to account for the dosage of the program, as some vocational training programs may have different lengths or intensities and an individual’s length of time studying is not examined here. Similarly, an individual’s skill or proficiency level is not captured beyond a binary measure of completion; therefore, individual differences in the success of the training may not be captured in this study. Future research should incorporate these issues while examining how specific vocational programs relate to post-release outcomes. Finally, future research should explore how correctional programming leads to desis-tance, rather than simply measuring whether there are reductions in official measures of reoffending (see Rocque, 2021). Notably, the current study follows recent recom-mendations to incorporate the process of desistance into measurements of post-release outcomes by accounting for the timing of recidivism rather than relying on a binary measure (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2022).
In conclusion, after accounting for selection bias by using PSM, individuals who 
obtained vocational certificates, diplomas, or licenses had similar outcomes in terms of recidivism and employment as those who did not. Instead of directly affecting recidivism or employment, these programs may have helped motivated individuals who were already likely to succeed meet their career goals. Educational programs meant to improve employment outcomes should prioritize high-risk individuals with high employment needs to the extent this is possible without forgoing other rehabilita-tive programming, incorporate the continuum of care principle, build relationships with community employers, and address practical barriers to finding work. Further, given the recent increase in telework (e.g., Mouratidis & Papagiannakis, 2021) and the slightly better outcomes among those who studied computer careers or mechanical drafting and design while incarcerated, it could be beneficial to expand training  
in areas that lend themselves to remote office work. Finally, the results

showing differences before and during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest there may be 
significant historical threats to validity when comparing individuals released at differ -
ent time periods. Future research should consider the timing of a person’s release, as COVID-19 reduction strategies in place at that time might affect their outcomes.

 DO FAITH -BASED PRISONS WORK? 
Alexander Volokh* 
ABSTRACT  
This Article examines everything we know about the effectiveness of 
faith-based prisons, which is not very much. 
Most studies cannot be taken seriously  because they are tainted by the 
“self-selection problem.” It is hard to determine the effect of faith-based prison programs because they are voluntary, and volunteers are more likely to be motivated to change and are therefore already less likely to commit 
infractions or be re-arrested. This pr oblem is the same one that education 
researchers have struggled with in de termining whether private schools are 
better than public schools. 
The only credible studies done so far compare participants with non-
participants who volunteered for the program but were rejected. Some stu-dies in this category find no effect, bu t some do find a modest effect. But 
even those that find an effect are subject to additional critiques: for in-
stance, participants may have benefited from being exposed to treatment 
resources that non-participants were denied. 
Thus, based on current research, ther e is no strong reason to believe 
that faith-based prisons work. Howeve r, there is also no strong reason to 
believe that they do not work. I conclude  with thoughts on how faith-based 
prison programs might be improved, and offer a strategy that would allow 
such experimentation to proceed c onsistent with the Constitution.

I. INTRODUCTION  
There are five things one should know about faith-based prisons: 
 (1) There are a lot of them out there.  As of 2005, eighteen states and 
the federal government had some sort of residential faith-based pro-gram,
1 aimed at rehabilitating participating inmates by teaching 
them subjects like “ethical decision-making, anger management, 
victim restitution,”2 and substance abuse3 in conjunction with reli-
gious principles.

(2) One of them—the InnerChange Freedom Initiative program in 
Iowa—was struck down on Establishment Clause grounds in 2006,4 
but various faith-based prison programs still exist,5 including In-
nerChange programs in other states.6 InnerChange programs, which 
are explicitly motivated by Christian and Biblical principles,7 are 
probably more vulnerable to c onstitutional challenges; programs 
that are more interfaith and have less explicitly religious content, 
like Florida’s Faith- and Ch aracter-Based Institutions8 or the federal 
Life Connections Program,9 are probably less so. 
 (3) Faith-based prisons continue to be  promoted as promising avenues 
for reform, chiefly on the grounds that they improve prison discip-line and reduce recidivism.
10 
 
(4) However, most of the empirical studies of the effectiveness of faith-
based prisons have serious methodological problems and, to the ex-tent they find any positive effect  of faith-based prisons, can’t be 
taken at face value. 
 
(5) Those few empirical studies that approach methodological validity 
either fail to show that faith-based prisons reduce recidivism or provide weak evidence in their favor. 
 In what follows, I explain and critically evaluate the empirical studies of the 
effectiveness of faith-based prisons. Th e reader who gets through this Ar-
ticle will know everything that we currently know about whether they “work,” by which I mean, chiefly, whet her they reduce in-prison infractions 
or some measure of post-release recidivism, such as time to re-arrest, prob-ability of re-arrest, or probability of reconviction. 
As the summary above indicates, we  don’t know much about the effec-
tiveness of faith-based prisons. This is  a shame, because the empirics of 
faith-based prisons are important, both to the legal community and to poli-
cymakers generally.

46 Alabama Law Review  [Vol.63:1:43 
First, we should care about the empirics because faith-based prisons and 
rehabilitative services are, and will con tinue to be, on the cutting edge of 
Establishment Clause litigation,11 and empirics matter in the law. One might 
think that whether a program works shoul dn’t matter to whether it’s consis-
tent with the Establishment Clause cases; but in fact, there are several areas in Establishment Clause doctrine that s eem to allow targeted uses of statis-
tical evidence.
12 
In any event, regardless of whether empirics should  matter in Estab-
lishment Clause cases, reading judici al opinions suggests that they do. 
In Americans United for Separation of  Church & State v. Prison Fel-
lowship Ministries , which invalidated Iowa’s contract with the InnerChange 
Freedom Initiative, District Judge Robert Pratt, immediately before launch-ing into his Establishment Clause anal ysis, concluded his description of the 
faith-based program with the following complaint: 
More significant [than the warden’s personal testimony about the 
program’s beneficial in-prison effect], however, is the lack of evi-dence presented by the Defendants about the effect of InnerChange on recidivism. Aside from anecdotes, the Defendants offered no de-finitive study about the actual eff ects the InnerChange program has 
on recidivism rates. [The warden’s] predecessor . . . communicated 
his desire early on in the initial RFP process that accountability for the program be included in the c ontractual agreement between the 
parties. Specifically, he requested “at least annual program evalua-tions to include, but not limited to, re-incarceration rates and other 
measurable outcomes.” But, in fact, there was no information pre-
sented at trial about whether InnerC hange participants are more or 
less prone to recidivism than other inmates.
13 
Of course, finding empirical language  in opinions isn’t definitive evi-
dence that the empirics are relevant. Maybe judges who claim to care about 
the effectiveness of faith-based programs are just indulging in legally mea-
ningless rhetoric designed to support a conclusion they already arrived at by strictly legal means. On the other hand, if judges discuss empirical data,

Udow, 479 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 2007); Freedom from Religion Found., Inc. v. McCallum, 324 F.3d 880 
(7th Cir. 2003); Williams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171 (Tex. 2001); see also  Ira C. Lupu & Robert W. Tuttle,

text, they could help establish whether there was sub tle pressure to join a program, or whether instead 
participants joined a program becau se of valid quality reasons. Effectiv eness studies could help establish 
a secular purpose in cases wh ere the purpose is doubtful. Cf. Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 
921, 931–32 (N.D. Cal. 2010).

chances are that they believe the extra rh etorical force is useful in persuad-
ing someone  and thus makes their opinion more  influential and less subject 
to reversal.14 
Moreover, if we put our  Legal Realist hats on,15 maybe it’s the judges’ 
views of effectiveness that are driving their legal conclusions (at least for some  judges, who aren’t in favor of or against faith-based prisons on ideo-
logical grounds). At the very least, if judges believe that a program is effec-tive, they may think it’s a shame if the program were to be found unconsti-
tutional and might therefore be extra careful in their legal analysis to avoid 
striking it down. (If we disagree with their conclusion, we might replace the word careful  in the previous sen tence with the word imaginative .) Con-
versely, if they believe a program is ineffective, they may feel no particular pressure to uphold it. 
Perhaps a better piece of evidence that the empirics matter is that law-
yers spend time discussing empirical st udies in their briefs. Perhaps in re-
sponse to Judge Pratt’s concern, when  the case came up to the Eighth Cir-
cuit, the Alliance Defense Fund and ot hers submitted an amicus brief ar-
guing that “InnerChange’s faith-based  rehabilitative pris on programs are 
proven to reduce recidivism.”
16 (Unfortunately, of the two studies cited fa-
vorably in their brief, one has serious methodological problems,17 while the 
other, properly interpreted, shows no beneficial effect of the program.18) 
Empirical data also seems important in other Establishment Clause con-
texts. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , which upheld an Ohio program that 
allowed publicly funded vouchers to be  redeemed at religious schools, Jus-
tice Souter’s dissent cited statistics on the academic performance of schools 
to judge whether the parents’ choices were “genuine.”19 Justice O’Connor’s 
concurrence similarly used performance statistics to rebut Justice Souter’s argument.
20 
Justice Thomas, for his part, noted that “the success of religious and 
private schools is in the end beside the point, because the State has a consti-
tutional right to experiment with a va riety of different programs to promote 
educational opportunity.”21 But that didn’t stop him from marshalling statis-
tics to argue that “[r]eligious schools, like other private schools, achieve far

better educational results than their public counterparts.”22 “That Ohio’s 
program includes successful schools,” Ju stice Thomas wrote, “simply indi-
cates that such reform can in fact pr ovide improved education to underprivi-
leged urban children.”23 Here, too, seasoned appellate litigators spent sever-
al pages of their Supreme Court brief discussing the history and perfor-mance of voucher programs
24—and this was in a party’s argument, not just 
an amicus brief25—though this discussion was ostensibly not “to convince 
the Court that parental choice is proper public policy.”26 
But perhaps more importantly, we should care about the empirics be-
cause, whether or not they should matter in the law,27 they obviously should 
matter in policy. If faith-based prisons don’t reduce recidivism, the case for their funding is correspondingly weak ened (though they may still be sup-
ported by other arguments).
28 If they do reduce recidivism, or if they have 
other policy advantages, then even if judges are wrong to stretch the law to 
find them constitutional, we aren’t wrong to try to find ways to allow them 
to function constitutionally.29 After all, even the non-religious have an inter-
est in the rehabilitation of prisoners, a nd if religion can play a positive role 
in rehabilitation, this may be good news not only to the irreligious but even 
to those who are hostile to religion. 
It is thus unfortunate that the lega l literature hasn’t done a good job eva-

studies. Some legal articles do address the empirical evidence,30 but their 
discussions are generally quite cursory.31 
Outside of the legal literature, a fe w review articles do take a broader 
approach.32 Some even single out which articles they believe are methodo-
logically more valid than others.33 But, unfortunately for other scholars, 
these generally have no in-depth discussion of the studies being reviewed, nor do they discuss why the studies identified as superior really are superior. 
The rest of us are thus left to either take them at their word (I myself disag-
ree with some of their assessments)
34 or track down the studies (many of 
which are hard to find) and read th em ourselves—a daunting task for those 
without empirical training.35 
This Article fills the void. More sp ecifically, this Article makes three 
distinct contributions. 
First, I provide a detailed critical discussion of (to my knowledge) every 
existing empirical study on the effectiveness of faith-based prison programs. 
The word every  in the last sentence masks a few critical decisions. In 
making such a survey, I have chosen to include certain kinds of studies and exclude others. Because the relevant  legal issues center around “immer-
sion”-style faith-based prison units “tha t seek to immerse prisoners in an 
almost monastic or total experience of religiously based living,”
36 I exclude 
studies that explore more general issues like the effect of “religiosity.”37 The   
 31. The most comprehensive law review treatment of the empirical studies discusses five different 
empirical studies of faith-based prison programs. Davids, supra  note 30, at 350–63 (citing Johnson et al., 
infra  note 193; Johnson, infra  note 201; J OHNSON & LARSON , infra  note 282; J EANETTE HERCIK ET AL .,

note 307); id. at 32 (citing O’Connor et al., infra  note 342)). But it accepts their positive conclusions 
largely uncritically, whereas only three of these st udies approach methodological soundness. (I discuss 
JOHNSON & LARSON , infra  note 282, H ERCIK ET AL ., infra  note 307, and O’C ONNOR ET AL ., infra  note 
331, in Part III infra .) Moreover, of those three, two, properly interpreted, show no effect, see infra  text 
accompanying notes 282 and 307, and the th ird shows, at most, weak effects. See infra  text accompany-
ing note 331; see also  infra  Part IV (resources problem).

evaluates the methodology of some of his own studies . I disagree with O’Connor’s assessment of one of 
the studies, which he ranks “good,” see O’Connor et al. infra  note 65, but which I lump in with the 
studies marred by “naked self-selection.” I also  disagree with some of Aos’s assessments. See AOS infra  
notes 111, 135, & 201.

measures of religiosity, in these studies, are either general measures of how 
religious an inmate feels or how ma ny times an inmate attends religious 
services in prison. These studies may be valuable for some purposes, but 
they don’t help in evaluating immers ion-style faith-based units since ordi-
nary prison worship services are both widespread and uncontroversial. 
I instead focus on studies of the eff ectiveness of specific faith-based in-
terventions on variables of interest like the likelihood of recidivism. I also include studies of religious after-care for released inmates, even though 
these aren’t technically in-prison programs.
38 
Second, I provide a detailed discussion of the methodological issues in-
volved in evaluating faith-based prisons  generally. In statistics, methodolo-
gy is everything; it’s a shame that the legal community, which often relies on these empirical studies, isn’t as sophisticated as it could be at telling va-
lid studies apart from invalid ones. 
Roughly speaking, the studies fall into four categories. Three of them—
naïve comparisons of participants to  non-participants, comparisons with 
some controls, and matching based on  propensity scores—aren’t credible 
because they don’t account for what is, in my view, the most serious ob-stacle to effective assessment: the “self-selection problem.” Inmates who 
are motivated enough to choose to partic ipate in a rehabilitative program are 
already less likely to reoffend. So an y study that compares voluntary partic-
ipants and voluntary non-participants may just be picking up the effect of being a good person, not the effect of the program itself. (Some of these

ty), https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/184508. pdf (using Prisoner Values Survey and similar 
attitudinal variables). 
 38. I have also excluded programs whose religiosity is unclear. Transcendental Meditation, for 
instance, is considered religious by some and non-religious by others. Compare, e.g. , Amy Karasz & 
Meaghan Midgett, Transcendental Meditation , http://web.archive.org/web/20060831081613/religious 
movements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/tm.html (last modified Jan. 12, 2001), with The Technique,  THE 
TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION PROGRAM , http://www.tm.org/meditation-techniques (last visited Oct. 
26, 2011). Cf. Debbie Elliott, At End-of-the-Line Prison, An Unlikely Escape , NPR, http://www.npr.org/

Vipassana technique, though secular, is based on the teachings of Buddha .”). In any event, Transcenden-
tal Meditation is quite different from the other so rts of religious programs canvassed in this survey. 
Nonetheless, a number of studies purport to find that Trancendental Meditation reduces recidivism. 
Below, see infra  note 161, I cite two studies that belong in the “Studies with Some Controls” Part—that 
is, studies that do not adequate ly control for self-selection.

studies are subject to even further sour ces of bias. For instance, in addition 
to self-selection in the decision whether and how intensively to participate, 
there can be selection by the program staff in the decision of whom to admit 
or whom to kick out,39 as well as “success bias” in the consideration only of 
those who completed the program without dropping out.40) 
In my view, the only credible studies so far fall into a fourth category—
those that compare (voluntary) participants in faith-based programs with people who volunteered for the program but were rejected.
41 And even these 
studies are subject to the “resources problem”: they compare participation in 
the program either with the alternativ e of no program at all or with the 
“business as usual” alternative of what ever other programs happened to be 
available, rather than with participa tion in a comparably funded secular pro-
gram. Thus, even if a religious program is better than nothing at all, it could 
be because of the greater access to treatment resources—for instance, men-
tors and counselors—and not because of  the religious content of the pro-
gram.42 
Third, I set the empirical debate on faith-based prisons side by side with 
a parallel empirical debate: whether private schools are better than public schools. One striking aspect of the faith -based prisons research is how much 
it looks like the private school research. (Some of this research studies not 
private schools as such, but Catholic schools, since most private schools are 
religious, and Catholic schools are a homogeneous enough group to be sus-
ceptible to generalization.) Both faith-based prisons and private schools are subject to self-selection—any naïve comparison between, on the one hand, 
secular prisons or public schools and, on the other hand, faith-based prisons 
or private/Catholic schools is subject to  the critique that the private or reli-
gious options have to be affirma tively chosen, and people who are moti-
vated enough—or whose parents ar e motivated enough—to make that 
choice are already more likely to be high-achieving students or low-
recidivism inmates.
43 
While sophisticated researchers in both areas are aware of the self-
selection problem, the education literature has addressed it far more con-
  
 39. E.g. , the Brazil study, infra  text accompanying notes 52–64; the theology study, infra  text ac-
companying notes 65–68; and the Texas InnerChange studies, infra  text accompanying notes 282–290. 
 40. E.g. , the Brazil study, infra  text accompanying notes 52–64; the Florida DOC’s Kairos Horizons 
study, infra  text accompanying notes 77–84; th e Texas InnerChange studies, infra  text accompanying

O’Connor et al.’s TOP study, infra  text accompanying notes 331–342. 
 41. There are other promising statistical techniques, but so far they apparently haven’t been used in 
the faith-based prison context. See infra  Part III.A. 
 42. See  infra  Part IV. 
 43. An analogous problem occurs in various studies  of the effectiveness of private prisons. A com-
parison of public to private prisons is biased if the private prisons studied, rather than getting a random 
sample of inmates, were sent a sample of inmates that was systematically h ealtheir or less dangerous 
than average. See, e.g. , Richard A. Oppel Jr., Private Prisons Found to  Offer Little in Savings , N.Y.  
TIMES , May 18, 2011 (“‘It’s cherry picking,’ said Stat e Representative Chad Ca mpbell, leader of the 
House Democrats. ‘They leave the most expensive prisoners with taxpayers and take the easy prison-
ers.’”).

scientiously and has progressed further th an the prisons literature in advanc-
ing our empirical knowledge. Perhaps prison researchers could learn some-
thing from school researchers’ example. 
In the end, this Article has bad news and good news. The bad news, as I’ve said above, is that most studies are low quality, 
and the results of the higher quality studi es aren’t promising. There seems to 
be little empirical reason to believe  that faith-based prisons work. 
The good news is that there’s also no proof that they don’t  work. The 
absence of statistically valid or statistically significant findings isn’t the 
same as the presence of negative findings. And while the self-selection problem is real and important, the resources problem may not even be a problem at all: maybe the “zero alternative” or the “business as usual” alter-natives really are proper empirical baselines, since they reflect both reality 
and, perhaps, political feasibility. So the picture isn’t uniformly bleak: there 
are some  programs that seem to show some  statistically significant effects, 
even if they are weak and even if we’re not sure how well they compare to the hypothetical effects of a hypothetical, comparably funded secular pro-gram. 
Perhaps future research will shed light on these questions. In the mean-
time, clearly some groups want to have  such prisons, some inmates want to 
attend them, and they probably do little if any harm. If some programs don’t 
work, this is an indication to future practitioners that something needs to be 
changed; if some programs work, mayb e they can be replicated elsewhere. 
Better results won’t emerge unless they’re allowed to emerge by a process 
of experimentation. As I’ve suggested  above, it would be a shame if this 
process is cut off for constitutional r easons, provided there is a constitution-
ally valid way for them to proceed. 
At the end of this Article, I suggest such a way. Faith-based prisons, as 
currently constituted, are probabl y unconstitutional under modern Estab-
lishment Clause doctrine. But they w ould become fully constitutional under 
a system of prison vouchers that would allow inmates to choose their own prisons, whether secular or religious. I develop this idea at length else-where,
44 but the bottom line is that, despite  the current weak evidence, some 
version of faith-based prisons may still work, and there is a way for that version to emerge consiste nt with the Constitution. 
II.
 THE SELF-SELECTION PROBLEM  
The most serious problem with studies of the effectiveness of faith-
based prisons is the self-selection problem. Prisoners obviously select into faith-based prisons voluntarily.
45 And the factors that would make an inmate

 45. At least in the United States, this would be so clearly required by the Establishment Clause that, 
even if the programs are ultimately found to be uncons titutional, this is a featur e that the designers of 
such programs would be sure to include.

select a faith-based prison may also make him less likely to commit crimes 
in the future.46 One such factor might be religiosity itself.47 In addition, an 
inmate who takes the trouble to choose to join a rehabilitative program may 
be more motivated and more open to change, and this may itself make him 
more likely to change—regardless of whether the program actually “works.” 
The following Parts illustrate three ty pes of studies that don’t adequate-
ly control for self-selection, both for faith-based prisons and for the analog-
ous context of private/Catholic schools.
48 
The first type of study shows the self-selection problem in its most 
naked form: it simply compares the resu lts of participants in a faith-based 
program with those of non-participants. 
The second type of study accounts for some of the differences between 
participants and non-participants by comparing the group of participants 
with a matched group of non-participants, where the matching is based on various observable factors like race, ag e, criminal history, and the like.
49 
But, of course, such a procedure can’t control for unobservable  variables, 
like motivation to change. 
The third type of study uses a more sophisticated statistical technique 
called “propensity score” matching. Participants are matched to non-
participants not based on observable factors directly, but based on their pro-pensity score, that is, their estimated probability of participating in the pro-gram. While propensity scores are a useful technique in some applications, they don’t alleviate the self-selection problem in the faith-based prison con-
text. 
A. Naked Self-Selection 
The studies in this section purport to fi nd a positive effect of faith-based 
prisons based on comparing, say, recidivism rates of participants in faith-based units and prisoners in the genera l population or in different prisons. 
But these sorts of studies aren’t credib le because they make no effort to 
control for self-selection. “Without knowledge of the selection process, there is no way to determine whether observed differences between program participants and ‘comparisons’ are due to actual program effects or are an

 47. E.g. , sources cited supra  note 37. I don’t want to oversell this point, since it takes no imagina-
tion at all to imagine religiously inspired violence;  moreover, one observes associations between white 
prison gangs and forms of Christian ity or neopaganism (Odinism or Asatru), and between black prison 
gangs and forms of Islam. 
 48. See supra  text accompanying note 42. 
 49. Matching—a method from epidemiology—is commonly used in faith-based prison studies. In education studies, instead of matching, generally we ha ve a large number of observations of participants 
and non-participants; no one is “matched” to anyone else, but the researchers “control” for observable 
factors in a statistical sense, by including those factors as independent variables in a regression.

artifact of preexisting differences between the groups.”50 Rather than giving 
us the effect of faith-based prisons , these studies may be giving us the effect 
of faith-based prisoners .51 
1. Johnson’s Brazil Study 
Byron Johnson compared recidivism among inmates in two Brazilian 
prisons: Humaitá, a faith-based facility, and Bragança, a secular facility with vocational training programs.
52 Data wasn’t available for 46% of the 
inmates, though the data loss didn’t differ significantly between the two 
prisons.53 High-risk Humaitá inmates had significantly54 lower recidivism—
12% of the high-risk Humaitá inmates were re-arrested after three years, versus 38% of the high-risk Bragança inmates.
55 The average number of re-
arrests was also significantly lower for Humaitá prisoners56—even though 
on average the original offenses of the Humaitá prisoners had been more 
serious, they were more likely to be  violent, and they had possibly served 
more time in prison.57 
The main problem with this study is that prisoners apply to be in Hu-
maitá, prisoners’ families must be “i nvolved in the prisoner’s recuperation 
process,” prisoners aren’t accepted without sufficient “motivation and 
commitment to change,” and prisoners  don’t stay unless they and the prison 
agree after an initial 60-day assessment period.58 The results are thus tainted 
by multiple sources of bias: self-selection, selection by the prison itself, and success through the assessment period. 
Moreover, among low-risk inmates, recidivism rates weren’t signifi-
cantly different between the two prisons.
59 There was no significant differ-

methodological quality (on a poor-fai r-good-excellent scale). O’Connor, supra  note 33, at 23 tbl.3. The

ence between times to re-arrest60 or the severity of the subsequent offense.61 
The reincarceration rate was lower am ong Humaitá inmates, but “the validi-
ty of this finding is questionable due to extensive data loss.”62 Moreover, 
many relevant background factors, like age or criminal history, weren’t con-sidered, perhaps because the data wasn’t available.
63 
Finally, Humaitá differs from othe r Brazilian prisons (possibly includ-
ing Bragança) in many ways unrelated to religion. The environment is more 
pleasant, prisoners and their families are treated better, there are more (non-
religious) activities, and so on.64 Any improvements in recidivism could 
therefore have been caused not only by selection, but also by better secular prison conditions. 
2. O’Connor et al.’s Theology Study 
Thomas O’Connor and his coauthors compared recidivism between 54 
inmates who participated in a master’s  program in theology at Sing Sing 
prison and 402 non-participants.
65 Completion of the ministry program was 
associated with a significantly lower risk  of re-arrest in the first 28 months 
out of prison—only 9% of participants  were re-arrested, compared to 37% 
of non-participants.66 
However, both self-selection and selection by program administrators 
taint these results. The students were selected by “a highly competitive ap-
plication and reference process”; th e program was open only to inmates 
with a college degree, who read and wrote well, and who had “references from chaplains and other inmates attes ting to their religious commitment” 
and showed “a deep willingness to turn their lives around.”
67 In fact, accord-
ing to the president of the seminary that ran the theology program, the pro-
gram had “built-in success” because they  made sure to accept applicants

3. Kerley et al.’s Religiosity Study 
Kent Kerley and his coauthors examined the relationship between reli-
giosity and negative prison behaviors at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 
Parchman, Mississippi.69 First, they measured inmates’ religiosity using a 
survey.70 Most of these measures are irrelevant for our purposes because 
they don’t involve specific programming71—for instance, inmates were 
asked whether they had experienced a conversion and whether they believed 
in God.72 But one of the measures was attendance at a one-day Prison Fel-
lowship Ministries event called Operation Starting Line, “which included Christian musicians, comedians, professional athletes, and other speakers,” and which was held about six months before the survey.
73 
Participation in Operation Starting Line predicted a significantly re-
duced rate of arguing  with other inmates—52.5% of participants argued 
with other inmates once or more per month, as opposed to 60.0% of non-participants.
74 But participants and non-particip ants didn’t differ statistically 
significantly in their likelihood of fighting once or more per month—18.9% for participants versus 19.3% for non-participants.
75 
Inmates, of course, self-selected into the Starting Line events. In addi-
tion, the data was collected by a surv ey distributed to inmates, where both 
religiosity and negative behaviors were  self-reported, where participation in 
the survey was voluntary, and where the response rate was 45%.76

months.78 The 59 inmates who spent the entire six-month program at the 
faith-based dorm were compared to 8 inmates who didn’t complete the six 
months, 741 inmates at Tomoka who di dn’t participate at all, and 54,997 
inmates at other Florida prisons.79 (The comparison groups were also li-
mited to inmates without disciplinary reports in the previous six months.)80 
Inmates who completed the six-month program had lower rates of dis-
ciplinary reports than non-participants or inmates at other Florida prisons; 
about 5% of completers received discipl inary reports, compared to 37.5% of 
non-completers, 17% of non-participants , and 12% of inmates at other pris-
ons.81 If—to see the effect of participation rather than the effect of program 
completion—we lump non-completers and completers together, the rate 
becomes about 9%,82 which isn’t significantly different from the rate among 
non-participants at Tomoka or at other prisons.83 
A similar faith-based program in England also reports greater discipli-
nary improvement among program participants.84

and 617 didn’t (for a rate of 17%). Among the 54,997  non-participants at ot her prisons, 6,614 received 
disciplinary reports and 48,383 didn’t (for a rate of 12%). The difference between the participants’ 
disciplinary report rate of 9% and the Tomoka non-partic ipants’ rate of 17% has a p-value of 0.08, so it 
isn’t significant at the 5% significance level. The diffe rence between the participan ts’ rate of 9% and the 
other-prison non-participants’ rate of 12% has a p-valu e of 0.45, so it isn’t significant at any reasonable 
significance level.

control group had a 23.4% recidivism  rate; the Kairos group had a 15.7%  recidivism rate; and those who

Denny examined three cohorts of pa rticipants, from “Year One” (2002), 
“Year Two” (2003), and “Year Three” (2004).86 The 36 Year One partici-
pants had 89% fewer misconduct reports after the program than before; the 
drop for the 51 Year Two participants was 80%; and the drop for the 51 Year Three participants was 84%.
87 The average drop was 86%.88 Miscon-
duct reports in the entire facility fe ll from 901 to 308 (a 66% drop) from 
Year One to Year Three,89 which is presumably comparable to the 80% 
before-to-after drop for the Year Tw o participants. It’s unclear from the 
paper how many inmates there were at the facility during this time, so it’s 
unclear whether the drop in misconduc t among program participants is sig-
nificantly different from the total decrease facility-wide. 
When the paper was written, only seven  participants had been released, 
the longest-released graduate had only been out for one year, and no gradu-
ate had been re-arrested.90 So the author couldn’t report “true recidivism 
rates” by Oklahoma standards, which require a three-year post-release histo-ry.

6. Education Studies 
Some education studies also use th is approach, neither addressing self-
selection nor controlling for observable variables. 
One example is Janet Beales and Maureen Wahl’s assessment of the 
Partners Advancing Values in Evaluation (PAVE) program in Milwaukee,92 
a privately funded voucher system that functioned parallel to the publicly funded voucher system, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP).
93 
Beales and Wahl found that 63.2% of  PAVE students scored above the 50th 
percentile in reading (60.4% in math),  which was much higher than the cor-
responding percentages for MPCP students, Milwaukee public school low-income students, or all Milwaukee public school students.
94 (These percen-
tages were all between 16% and 35%.) PAVE students were similarly above the three comparison groups in readin g and math test score medians and 
means.

However, the PAVE group differed from the other groups in various 
ways. Most obviously, the PAVE group, like the MPCP group, was self-
selected, since one had to apply for a voucher; the public school students 
weren’t self-selected.96 But the PAVE group and the MPCP group weren’t 
comparable either: the PAVE scores were  the test results of seventh-grade 
students, while the MPCP scores were test results from multiple grade le-
vels, so the authors weren’t even comparing the same test.97 Finally, the 
authors couldn’t control for income, parental education, or other variables.98 
B. Studies with Some Controls 
The studies in the previous section ar en’t credible because participants 
in religious programs are just so di fferent from non-participants. One possi-
ble fix would be to control for observa ble differences between participants 
and non-participants.99 This is what the studies reported in this section do: 
participants are matched with non-par ticipants with observable characteris-
tics that are as similar as possible. 
But these studies are still vulnerabl e. An unobserved variable—
motivation to change—affects both whether the inmate participates and 
whether he reoffends.100 Because motivation and success (avoiding re-
arrest) are positively correlated, any effect we find is probably biased up-
ward (ignoring any other sources of bias in one direction or another). A true 
zero effect may look like a positive effect because we’re measuring the ef-fect of motivation.
101 
In other words, if two prisoners are perfectly matched on the obser-
vables, but one of them chose to participate and the other didn’t, these two 
prisoners aren’t really well matched. Any study that finds better results 
among participants is thus still subject to self-selection bias.102 
1. La Vigne et al.’s Florida Study 
Nancy La Vigne and her coauthors reported on six- and twelve-month 
recidivism rates of participants in two Florida “faith- and character-based 
institutions” (FCBI)—one male (Lawte y) and one female (Hillsborough).103 
  
 96. Id.  at 60. There may have been other self-selecti on biases: the PAVE test scores were voluntari-
ly revealed by some of the participating parents, and perhaps parents would be  more willing to reveal 
their children’s test scor es if they were high.

Participants were matched with a co ntrol group based on “sex, age, race, 
primary offense type, violent/non-violent offense, number of prior incarce-
rations, time incarcerated for current o ffense, time to expected release, and 
pre-study disciplinary report rate.”104 
At first, male FCBI participants had lower recidivism rates than their 
control group—none of the 189 male inmates from Lawtey were reincarce-rated after six months, compared to four of the 189 male comparison in-mates (2.1%).
105 There was no significant difference for females,106 and 
twelve months out, there was no significant effect at all for either males or 
females.107 There was also no significant diffe rence between average time to 
reincarceration for the faith-based inma tes and the comparison inmates, for 
either males or females.108 The results here are thus extremely weak.109 
A later report by Diana Brazzell and Nancy La Vigne, using new data, 
continued to find “no statistically signi ficant difference . . . in the proportion 
of FCBI and non-FCBI inmates returned to prison within 12, 18, 24, and 26 months of release,” for either males or females.

2011] Faith-Based Prisons  61 
tenced prisoners released from pris ons in England and Wales in 1996 and 
1997 who were British nationals, had ser ved sentences of six months to 15 
years, had been released from particular categories of prisons, and satisfied 
a few additional restrictions.112 In the Kainos sample, 22.6% of the partici-
pants were reconvicted within a year of release; among non-participants, the 
percentage was 25.9%.113 This difference wasn’t significant.114 
So far, this didn’t control for any va riables. But Rose then went further, 
comparing the actual reconviction rates of Kainos participants with their 
own predicted  reconviction rates. The predicte d rates were based on a statis-
tical model that controlled for observable factors such as their sex, offense category, age at first conviction, age at sentence, months spent in prison after sentence, and number of custodial sentences before age 21.
115 Thus, 
rather than comparing participants  and non-participants, he compared actual  
participants with hypothetical  participants whose recidivism was predicted 
based on factors that didn’t include th eir participation in a faith-based pro-
gram. 
There, too, Rose found no significant effect: 25.0% of the Kainos sam-
ple was reconvicted, while the expected percentage would have been 26.0% or 24.2% (depending on which prediction model one used).

Participants were sent to Washington for a two-week faith and leadership 
seminar, and their recidivism was co mpared to that of a control group.118 
The control group was selected to match the experimental group with re-spect to race, gender, age at release, and the “salient factor score”
119 (an 
estimate of a prisoner’s likelihood of recidivism120). 
Participants’ recidivism rate was 40%, while the control group’s reci-
divism rate was 51%.121 Participating women had a recidivism rate of 19%, 
compared to 47% for the control women, and participating men had a reci-

Participants had lower infraction ra tes than non-participants: “9.9% of 
PF inmates had an infraction since attending at least one PF program com-
pared to the 23.2% of Non PF inmates who had an infraction.”128 The more 
an inmate participated in PF programs, the lower his chance of having an infraction.
129 
Controlling for prior violent convictions, age, marriage status, and days 
spent in the prison, whether an inmate  participated in PF programs strongly 
predicted lower infraction rates.130 “Non PF inmates were still 2.5 times 
more likely than PF inmates to have an infraction.”131 
The rate of participation in PF programs, controlling for the same va-
riables, likewise strongly predicted lower infraction rates.132 But controlling 
for the rate of participation isn’t u seful. Given a valid control group, the 
only valid comparison is between the control group and the entire  treatment 
group.133 If we compare the control group to isolated, self-selected subsets 
of the treatment group, like those who participated the most in PF programs, 
we are merely reintroducing another layer of self-selection bias. Even if high participation reduces infraction rates (which is doubtful, given that the 
high participants may already be bette r people), the relevant question from a 
policy  perspective, that is, from the perspective of someone wondering

for those who choose not to participate much.134 
5. Wilson et al.’s COSA Study 
Robin Wilson and coauthors examined the effect on recidivism of the 
Circles of Support and Accountability (COSA) program in south-central Ontario.
135 Unlike the programs discussed so  far, COSA isn’t an in-prison 
program; rather, it’s a support network, largely staffed by religious volun-teers, to support the reintegration of  released sex offenders into society.
136 A 
group of 60 sex offenders assigned to  COSA were compared against a 
group of non-participants who were si milarly detained, had similar recidiv-
ism risk categories, were released around the same time, and had similar “prior involvement in sexual offender treatment programming.”
137 The 
COSA group had significantly lower reci divism rates: the COSA group had 
a 5% rate of sexual recidivism and a 15% rate of violent recidivism, as 
compared to 17% and 35% among the comparison group.138 
Robin Wilson and coauthors found similar results in a follow-up study 
of COSA participants across Canada. There, too, the comparison group of 
44 COSA participants from assorted Canadian cities was matched, accord-
ing to similar control variables, to a group of sexual offenders who didn’t 
participate.139 The COSA group had lower rates of sexual recidivism 
(2.27%), violent recidivism (9.09%), and overall recidivism (11.36%) than the control group (13.67%, 34.09%, and 38.64%, respectively).

6. Self-Selection in Prisons and Schools 
As I’ve pointed out above,141 self-selection also plagues studies of the 
effectiveness of private schools.142 
  
 134. There is apparently a similar study (which I haven’t been able to obtain), also by Thomas 
O’Connor and coauthors, a nd with a similar title, T.P.  O’C ONNOR ET AL ., THE IMPACT OF RELIGIOUS 
PROGRAMS ON INMATE INFRACTIONS AT LIEBER PRISON IN SOUTH CAROLINA  (1997), cited in  Stephen 
T. Hall, Faith-Based Cognitive Programs in Corrections , CORRECTIONS TODAY , Dec. 2003, at 108, 
111–12. According to the Hall article, this study doesn’t  find any difference in infractions between the 
PF and non-PF groups, but a difference does emerge when the PF group is divided by levels of religious 
attendance. Id. at 111. This study is thus even less supportive of an effect of the religious program than is 
the study discussed in the text.  135. R

Early work by James Coleman and his coauthors estimated the effect of 
private schooling on sophomore scor es, controlling for various background 
characteristics.143 Coleman et al. recognized th at selection was a potentially 
serious problem,144 but noted that it was impossible to properly solve the 
problem “in the absence of random assignment to treatments, or something approximating it,” and that one  had to proceed regardless.
145 
Other studies found a weaker effect. Jay Noell,146 Doug Willms,147 Karl 
Alexander and Aaron Pallas,148 and William Morgan149 analyzed the same 
data with different specifications and different control variables and found a 
much weaker effect of private schools.150 John F. Witte and his coauthors 
found that students in the Milwaukee voucher program didn’t “differ in any predictable way on achievement tests”
 151 from Milwaukee public-school 
students over the first four years of the program.152 And, in a recent study,

Harold Wenglinsky similarly controlled for various observable variables 
and followed students over time, and f ound no positive effect for private 
schools.153 
Various studies found effects that differed according to the precise out-
come variable or the precise population being studied. Cecilia Rouse, com-paring Milwaukee voucher students with  Milwaukee public school students, 
found a substantial effect on math scor es, but no effect on reading scores, of 
being selected to attend a voucher school in Milwaukee.
154 Jeffrey Grogger 
and Derek Neal found significant eff ects on high-school graduation rates, 
college attendance rates, and math test scores.155 Gains for urban minorities 
were especially large, but there was “little evidence of math-achievement 
gains for suburban minorities in Catholic schools.”156 
Private-school researchers have also  investigated whether the public 
versus private choice affects the growth  of test scores from the sophomore 
to the senior year. Coleman and his coauthors did this by comparing two different cohorts—a sophomore class and a senior class in the same year.
157 
Later, John Chubb and Terry Moe,158 as well as Douglas Willms159 and Karl 
Alexander and Aaron Pallas,160 who had the benefit of follow-up data, com-
pared the sophomore and senior scores of the same students. But these me-
thods also don’t control for selection bias if one believes (as is plausible, 
and as Coleman et al. agree) that selectiv ity affects growth rates in addition 
to levels.161 
It should be clear that prison and education studies share common me-
thodological problems. We can discount any positive results of these studies

that if one finds positive effects of  attending a public school that “looks  like” a private school in terms of

as being potentially artifacts of self-selection.162 But what about the studies 
that found no effect—for instance, in the faith-based prison case, the La 
Vigne studies,163 and the Rose study?164 Surely, if positive results are over-
stated by some unknown amount, zero results must prove that faith-based prisons don’t work at all, and that the true effect is, if anything, negative? 
This is tempting, but we should resist this conclusion for the following 
reasons: 
 
• The self-selection bias overstates results, but there may be other em-
pirical problems that tend to understate results. For instance, there may be other unobserved variables that are negatively  correlated 
with success. (Perhaps people also tend to participate in programs if they feel they need it more? Perhap s programs that provide addition-
al resources to inmates and that are selective also attract inmates who 
are good at lying to the program administrators about their suitability 
for the program?
165 Perhaps, if participation in a program contributes 
to parole decisions, the program attracts problem inmates who are 
more likely to need the good points on their record? Generally, there is always a problem with insincere inmates who take advantage of 
religious programs to “gain protection,” “meet other inmates,” “inte-
ract with volunteers,” and “gain access to prison resources,”
166 quite 
apart from any desire to reform.) Or there may be measurement error in the dependent variable (i.e., some of the inmates who are re-arrested are wrongly coded as not having been re-arrested and vice versa), which tends to reduce the measured effect. So just as a posi-
tive measured effect could hide a true zero effect, a zero measured 
effect could hide a true positive effect. 
 
• Every program is different, and so me programs may only have a zero 
measured effect because they were badly designed or badly run. Their failure needn’t reflect badl y on other programs that are done 
well—in fact, even if only a handful of programs “work,” but if 
those programs, once they have been shown to work, can be repli-cated, the whole process of experimentation can be thought to have been a success. 
  
 162. Also, a few studies of Transcendental Meditation, see Karasz & Midgett, supra  note 38; Elliott,

• Alexander and Pallas noted that the effect of private schools ap-
peared much smaller when the follo w-up data was analyzed and stu-
dents’ previous test scores were used as controls for their current 
performance.167 This dramatic change from a background-controls-
only specification to a background-controls-and-test-scores specifi-cation, they argued, showed “that background proxies are simply in-adequate when attempting to assess the impact of school organiza-tion on cognitive outcomes.”
168 This is a modest moral of the “back-
ground proxy” studies: when one’s empirical method is subject to an 
important source of bias, the precise specification can have a large effect on the results. 
 
Perhaps most importantly, we now have other studies that are methodo-
logically more valid. We thus don’t n eed to spend too much time interpret-
ing the results of the less valid studies. 
C. Matching on the Propensity Score 
In this Part, I discuss a technically more sophisticated way of dealing 
with selection problems: propensity score matching.
169 
In propensity score matching, the researchers first identify the observa-
ble variables that best predict whethe r someone will participate in the pro-
gram.170 This first-stage estimation generates a “propensity score” for each 
inmate; this is essentially an estimated probability of participating in the program.
171 One inmate may have participated and the other may have not, 
but they may both have propensity scores of, say, 70%, so that they are es-
timated to be equally likely, ex an te, to have chosen to participate.172  
The matching process then matches each participant to another partici-
pant with a similar propensity score; a 70% propensity participating inmate 
is matched with a 70% propensity non-p articipating inmate, even if these 
inmates may differ on various individual characteristics.173

68 Alabama Law Review  [Vol.63:1:43 
Practitioners of propensity score matc hing point to certain advantages 
of the method over trying to match on observable variables directly.174 Giv-
en a participant with particular observable characteristics, it is often hard or 
impossible to find a non-participant with identical, or nearly identical, val-ues of those same variables; by contrast, it is easier to match according to a single number.
175 
But propensity score matching can’t overcome the problems of selec-
tion bias in the case of faith-based pris ons. To see this, suppose that there 
were so many non-participating prisoners that exact  matching on obser-
vables was always possible; every par ticipating inmate would be matched 
with a non-participant who looked exactly identical. Because these two in-mates would have identical observable characteristics, they would also have identical propensity scores. Matching on propensity scores would then pro-
duce exactly the same control group as the previous set of studies, which 
matched on observables directly. 
Thus, if the direct matching studies weren’t credible, the propensity 
score matching studies aren’t credible either. Using the propensity score may improve the efficacy of matching, but it doesn’t alleviate the self-selection problem.
176 
More technically, the problem is that  propensity score methods give the 
correct result if nonobservables play no role in the selection mechanism ,177 
or more precisely, if the unobserved de terminants of participation play no 
role in ultimate success (that is, low recidivism). This assumption is quite 
false in the case of faith-based prison programs, where motivation to 
change, and possibly religiosity itself, both determine participation in the 
program and play a large role in whether an inmate reoffends. James Heck-
man and Richard Robb argue that “[ t]he propensity score methodology 
solves a very special problem . . . that is  of limited interest to social science 
data analysts.”178 Whether Heckman and Robb are right about the interest of 
propensity score studies in general, fa ith-based prison evaluation certainly 
seems like one area where the method doesn’t seem credible.

sentence and initial security classification.”180 
The study found no significant difference between participants and the 
control group in prison infractions, nu mber of re-arrests, or time to re-
arrest.181 Among participants, 37% had infr actions: 28% had security infrac-
tions, 16% had nonviolent infractions , and 15% had violent infractions.182 In 
the control group, the percentages were 32%, 23%, 18%, and 11%, respec-
tively.183 None of these differences were significant.184 Nor was there any 
significant difference in the frequency of  re-arrest (36% for participants 
versus 34% for non-participants),185 though a difference emerged when ar-
rests were broken down by type of charge.186 Participants were “more likely 
to be re-arrested for a violent offen se” (28% versus 16%), but “less likely to 
be re-arrested for a drug offense” (21% versus 44%).187 There were also 
significant differences when re-arr ests were broken down by region—for 
whatever reason, a re-arrest of a partic ipant was more likely to occur in ups-
tate New York (and less likely to occu r in New York City or suburban New 
York) than the re-arrest of a non-participant.188 
The authors then divided the group into high-participating and low-
participating groups. There was still no  significant difference between high 
and low participants in infraction or re-arrest rates.189 The authors then 
computed a score from 0 to 3 for each inmate, based on the “Level of Su-pervision Inventory” that measured thei r estimated risk of being re-arrested, 
and then classified inmates by PF participation level (none, low, or high) 
and risk score (0, 1, 2, or 3).
190 When they did this, they found that among 
high-risk PF inmates—that is, inmates with a risk level of 3—high-participating inmates were significantly  less likely to be re-arrested than 
low-participating inmates.

However, as I have explained above,192 we shouldn’t read anything into 
this last set of results. Any analysis that divides inmates by levels of partici-
pation merely reintroduces self-selection bias. One can’t compare the con-
trol group against a self-selected sample  of the treatment group, nor can one 
compare self-selected parts of the treatment group (high Bible study partici-pants) against other self-selected parts (low Bible study participants). Even if this told us the effect of high par ticipation (which it probably doesn’t), the 
proper question for a policymaker deci ding whether to introduce such a 
program is how well it works for everyone, including those who choose not 
to participate much. 
2. Johnson et al.’s New York Study 
Byron Johnson and his coauthors reanalyzed this data,
193 using only 201 
inmates instead of the original 225.194 They found substantially the same 
results.195 There was no significant difference between participating and 
non-participating inmates in rates of in fractions (36% versus 31%), serious 
infractions (8% versus 9%), or  re-arrest (37% versus 36%).196 
When inmates were broken down by level of participation (low, me-
dium, or high), there continued to be no significant difference between Pris-on Fellowship (PF) and non-PF inmates,  except that high-participating PF 
inmates were re-arrested at lower rat es than their non-PF counterparts (14% 
versus 41%).
197 High-participating PF inmates were also significantly less 
likely to be arrested than low- or medium-participating PF inmates.198 The 
authors also further broke down inmates by risk level and found that high participation continued to be associated with a lower re-arrest rate.

But, as discussed above,200 we shouldn’t divide the sample based on 
participation level, since this introduces a new source of self-selection bias. 
When Johnson did a follow-up evaluation on these same inmates seven 
years later,201 he again found no significant difference in median time to re-
arrest or in reincarceration rates betw een participating a nd non-participating 
inmates.202 When the sample was divided into high- and low-participating 
groups, high-participating inmates had a lower two-year probability of re-
arrest than low-participating ones, bu t this effect disappeared after three 
years.203 
3. Camp et al.’s Life Connections Program Study 
Scott Camp and his coauthors analyzed the effect on prison misconduct 
of participation in the Life Connections Program.204 They estimated the 
probability of participation (i.e., pr opensity score) using a number of mod-
els; the fit of these models was reasonably good.205 Variables used included 
a “scale of motivation for change,” frequency of spiritual experiences and religious observance, religious affilia tion, “feelings of self-worth,” custody 
risk, previous incarceration, age, ethnicity, “race, sex, education, marital status, and months of current incarceration” so far.
206 
There was generally no significant association between participation 
and misconduct in general, and no ass ociation between pa rticipation and 
less serious misconduct.207 However, there was a significant association 
between participation and serious misconduct: in some of the models, 
“slightly over 5 percent of the inmates in the LCP had an instance of serious misconduct, where for the comparison group, the number was closer to 11 
percent.”
208 Other models on serious misconduct produced differences that 
were smaller, but still significant.209 
This article has a significant advantage that the others in this Subpart 
don’t have. I’ve argued that the problem with comparative studies, even ones based on propensity scores, is that they don’t get at the unobserved 
motivation to change. As I’ve noted above, though, Camp et al. explicitly

include “a scale of motivation for change” in their first-stage propensity 
model.210  If this scale accurately measur es motivation for change, then it 
can potentially solve the selection problem. Unfortunately, this scale, devel-
oped by Prochaska and DiClemente,211 is derived from inmates’ own self-
reported views,212 so it should be taken with a grain of salt. 
4. Education Studies 
As with the previous set of studies, this ground has already been trod-
den by education researchers, with similar methodological vulnerabilities. 
Unobserved motivation is as problematic with private or Catholic schools as 
with faith-based prisons—a student’s (or his parents’) motivation is corre-lated both with a decision to choose a different school and with success on outcomes like test scores.
213 
Thomas Hoffer and his coauthors (including James Coleman) predicted 
the probability that a student would choose a Catholic school using the 
background measures used in his base-year analysis and a measure of soph-omore achievement.
214 Then they “stratified the sa mple into quintiles of the 
propensity score[s] and estimated Cat holic-school effects within each of 
these homogeneous groups.”215 They found that controlling for selection 
using this method didn’t change the results much relative to the results ear-
lier in their paper, which they had estimated without propensity scores.216 
Stephen L. Morgan similarly estimated propensity scores and stratified 
the sample into quintiles.217 He found that “there is considerable variation in 
estimates of the average causal effect for Catholic school students with dif-
ferent propensities for attending Catholic schools”;218 “the Catholic students 
who are least likely to be enrolled in Catholic schools . . . are the most likely 
to benefit from having attended a Catholic school.”219 Overall, he found that 
students in Catholic schools benefite d from attending those schools, and—

unlike Hoffer et al.—the effect he estimated was larger  than the standard 
regressions that didn’t control fo r selection into Catholic schools.220 
In any event, because these studies don’t account for selection on unob-
servables, it isn’t worth dwelling on them at length. Since there are more valid studies that are able to control for selection on unobservables, let’s 
move on to those. 
III.
 POTENTIALLY VALID STUDIES  
The only credible studies of faith-base d prisons done so far have been 
those where the comparison group of inmates was made up of those who 
volunteered for the faith-based program but  were rejected. However, before 
describing those studies, I discuss a few empirical strategies that have been 
used for private schools but, for whatev er reason, haven’t been attempted 
for faith-based prisons: the instrumental variables method and identification 
by exogenous policy shocks. 
A. The Roads Not Taken 
The empirical literature on education is extremely large, and there has 
been a lot of debate on appropriate empirical methods. Here, I focus on two 
widely used approaches that can deal with selection: the instrumental va-
riables approach and the exogenous policy shock approach.221 
1. Instrumental Variables 
Standard regression models (the “ordinary least squares” method)222 
take as given that we won’t be able to explain all of the variable of interest, 
whether that variable is ex-prisoners’ recidivism or students’ test scores.223 
There will always be some error, as is recognized by the ε term in the stan-
  
 220. Id.  at 359. 
 221. Altonji et al. suggest another way of dealing with selection. They  estimate the effect of Catholic 
school on high school graduation and on college entrance assuming that “selection on the []observables 
is the same as selection on the [un]observables .” Joseph G. Altonji et al., Selection on Observed and 
Unobserved Variables: Assessing the Effectiveness of Catholic Schools , 113 J.  POL. ECON. 151, 154 
(2005) (emphasis added). Their method  
requires some strong assumptions . . . (1) that th e set of observed variables is chosen at ran-
dom from the full set of variables that dete rmine Catholic school a ttendance and high school 
graduation and (2) that the number of observed  and unobserved variables is large enough that 
none of the elements dominates the distri bution of school choice or graduation. 
Id. However, Altonji et al. “argue that these assump tions are no more objectionable than the assumptions 
needed to justify the standard ordinary least squa res (OLS) or univariate probit requirement that the 
index of unobservables that determ ine graduation has no relationship wi th Catholic school attendance.” 
Id. Altonji et al. find little evidence that Catholic school  affects test scores, but conclude that “Catholic 
high schools substantially increase the probability of gr aduating from high school a nd, more tentatively, 
attending college.” Id. at 152.

dard notation, y = Xβ + ε.224 The models do, however, demand that the av-
erage value of the error term, ε, not depend on the explanatory variables in 
X.225 It’s useful to think of the error as embodying not just whatever inhe-
rent randomness may exist in the world, but also every omitted variable. The requirement that ε, on average, not depend on X, can thus be interpreted 
as a rule that one can harmlessly omit variables (either by choice or because they’re unobservable) as long as the omitted variables are uncorrelated with the included ones.
226 
This is precisely the problem with selection bias: the inmates’ or the 
student’s parents’ motivation (which is an omitted variable and therefore 
part of the error term) is correlated with the main explanatory variable—
whether or not the inmate signs up for a faith-based prison program or the student attends a private or Catholic school. 
If we ran an ordinary least squares regression on the equation above, we 
would get biased estimates of β. But there are ways around this. Suppose we 
could find some other variable, Z, that predicted X but was uncorrelated 
with unobservable motivation. For in stance, suppose Catholic religion ( Z) 
predicted whether someone attended Catholic school ( X) (this seems true, 
since Catholics are more likely to attend Catholic school) but was uncorre-
lated with the unobservable determinan ts of scholastic success (this seems 
possible, since why would Catholics do better in school?).
227 We would call 
Z an instrument  for X. 
We would then use a two-stage process, called the instrumental va-
riables (or IV) method.228 Initially, we would use Z to obtain a predicted 
value of X—call it X'.229 Instead of having a 0 or 1 value of whether some-
one attended a faith-based prison progra m or Catholic school, we’d have 
their predicted  value based on Z; this would typically be a number between 
0 and 1,230 and we could think of it as their probability of attending the pro-
gram. 
Once this first stage was done and we had our predicted X', we would 
replace X with X' in the regression, and estimate the regression y = X'β + ε. 
We would then use the resulting estimate of β. (This method thus has the 
flavor  of matching based on propensity scores, as discussed above,231 but it 
has the advantage of being able to handle selection on unobservables.232)

 230. The value can be forced to be between 0 and 1, for instance if the initial regression of X on Z is 
in the probit form, a form often used for predicting probabilities.

 232. As applied to the selection problem, it’s pr imarily based on the work of James Heckman. James 
J. Heckman, Sample Selection Bias as  a Specification Error , 47 E CONOMETRICA  153 (1979). There’s a 
more complicated version of Heckman’s selection correction, which involves estimating two regres-
sions, one for participants and the other for non-par ticipants; this method has the advantage of not as-

2011] Faith-Based Prisons  75 
Mathematically, it turns out that, un like the naïve estimation, this two-
stage IV process gives us an unbiased estimate of β. The advantage of using 
X' instead of X is that, because X' is just predicted off of Z (which is uncor-
related with the error term), it isn’t “contaminated” by whatever is in the 
error term, like unobservable motivation.233 In essence, using the two-stage 
process has “purged” X of the pernicious effects of unobserved motivation. 
Of course, whether the IV method works depends on whether we can 
find a true instrument—something that really predicts X and is really uncor-
related with ε. Good instruments are hard to find. We can test whether Z 
predicts X—just try doing it and see how well it works—but we can’t direct-
ly test whether Z is correlated with ε, since the true error term is unknown; 
this is unfortunate, since even mode rate correlations can introduce substan-
tial bias into the IV estimates.234 
These potential problems haven’t stopped education researchers from 
using IV methods. 
James Coleman and his coauthors used two strategies. First, they used 
religion together with region (Northeast  or other) as instruments for Catho-
lic school attendance; then they used religion together with income and edu-
cational expectations in the eighth grade.235 They rejected both of these 
models because the resulting Catholic -school effect was implausibly 
large.236 But note that even if religion is a valid instrument,237 it seems that 
income and previous educational expectations should be  correlated with the 
unobservable determinants of scholastic success, which makes them invalid instruments. 
Other authors, using different speci fications, have found conflicting re-
sults. Jay Noell, in the reanalysis  of Coleman’s work discussed above,
238 
also used Catholic religion as an instrument for Catholic school atten-dance;
239 this made the Catholic-school effect insignificant.240 Richard Mur-
nane and his coauthors, on the other hand, used Catholic religion as an in-
strument and determined that Catholic school attendance had a significant 
effect on Hispanic students’, and possi bly also on black students’, achieve-
ment.241 
Using Catholic religion as an instrume nt seems to have fallen out of fa-
shion, after various researchers suggested  that being Catholic is unfortunate-
  
suming a constant effect of treatment. But I don’t di scuss it here because (1) it’s basically a generaliza-
tion of the Heckman method that I do discuss, and (2) neither faith-based prison nor private/Catholic 
education studies, to my knowledge, have used it.

ly correlated with the unobserved de terminants of scholastic success.242 The 
same goes for a related variable , frequency of church attendance.243 
A better instrument might be a variable unrelated to one’s own charac-
teristics—perhaps the Catholic shar e of the population of one’s county, 
which could affect Catholic school attendance just because Catholic-heavy 
counties have more Catholic schools and possibly lower tuitions because 
they’re more heavily subsidized by their local congregations.244 
Thus, William Evans and Robert Schwab used, among other variables, 
Catholic county population as an instrument.245 This strategy didn’t change 
the high-school graduation results much compared to a naïve specification 
without instruments, though the college  entrance results were more sensitive 
to the choice of specification.246 
Jeffrey Grogger and Derek Neal used the county’s Catholic school den-
sity and the county’s percentage of Catholic population.247 They found 
Catholic-school effects on high-school graduation for urban minorities that 
were even larger than in the models without selection.248 They also found 
significant effects for urban whites, though no effects for suburban students (whether white or minority).
249 There were no significant effects of Catholic 
school on college entrance.250 
Derek Neal used these same variables—county Ca tholic school density 
and county Catholic concentration—but not at the same time.251 He esti-
mated two different models since the validity of the instruments seemed to differ as between urban minorities and urban whites.
252 The analysis of mi-
norities used only Catholic school density as an instrument, while the analy-
sis of whites used only local Catholic population density.253 A positive ef-
fect of Catholic school attendance on high-school graduation rates remained 
after this correction for selection bias and, in fact, even increased.254

Other studies use instruments unrelated to Catholicism. William Sander 
and Anthony Krautmann used, among other variables, “urban” interacted 
with region and concluded that Catholic schooling has a highly significant 
negative effect on the probability that  a sophomore drops out before his 
senior year, but no effect on educational attainment beyond high school.255 
Dan Goldhaber also used a number of variables, including controls for 
the cost and availability of private schools, dummy variables for region and urbanicity, and percent of white students at the students’ school.
256 He 
found no positive sectoral effect favoring private schools.257 
David Figlio and Joe Stone predic ted sector choice using, among other 
factors, whether the state had “duty to bargain” or “right-to-work” laws, as well as median county income.
258 They found that private schools, whether 
religious or nonreligious, had no relatio n to math test scores, but were sig-
nificantly related to two years of college enrollment, as well as enrollment 
in a selective college.259 
All these models use different specifications, have different choices of 
instruments, and yield different results. Some find an effect of private or Catholic schools; some don’t. The moral, though, is that finding a good in-strument is hard. Many instrumental-variables studies have been sloppy 
about why the instrument Z is correlated with X and why it’s uncorrelated 
with 
ε.260 Pretty much any individual  attribute, whether Catholic religion, or 
income, or race, probably has some co rrelation with the unobserved deter-
minants of success.261 Aggregate  variables, like perhaps the Catholic popu-
lation density in the child’s county, may work better, but of course aggre-
gate variables may also affect achievement. Moreover, the aggregate ap-proach only works as an estimation stra tegy if we observe children from a 
large number of different aggregates: If all the children in the study come from the same county, we won’t be able  to use the local Catholic population 
density as an instrument since it will be the same for each child. 
This is a problem for faith-based prison studies as well. So far, almost 
all faith-based studies have analyzed the results of a single  faith-based pro-
  
graduation rates and on future wage s didn’t control for self-selection.  Id. at 117–18.

gram at one prison. Only a small number deal with more than one prison.262 
Perhaps an IV approach wouldn’t have been very useful in most of these 
cases, but it would be worth exploring the IV method when there is a data 
set with inmates from several prisons. 
2. Exogenous Policy Shocks 
Other studies have identified the eff ect of educational policies using ex-
ogenous shocks. Some of these are natu ral shocks; some are policy shocks 
when a policy is first introduced; some  are policy shocks when an already 
existing policy is applied in a particular context for a random reason. 
Here are some examples, unrelated to the public versus private school 
debate: 
 
• Caroline Hoxby identified the effect of class size on student 
achievement using two strategies.263 First, she used natural random-
ness in the population, which makes certain classes larger or smaller 
from year to year.264 Second, she used “the f act that class size jumps 
abruptly when a class has to be added to or subtracted from a grade because enrollment has triggered a maximum or minimum class size rule.”
265 (This is the “regression discontinuity” approach. )266 
Both strategies showed little or no effect of class size on achieve-
ment.267 
 
• Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy used a similar regression disconti-
nuity approach to study the effect of class size on achievement in Israel.
268 Unlike Hoxby, they found a negative effect of class size on 
achievement.269 (Of course, in all studies of this type, we want to 
guard against parents’ ability to game the system by choosing 
schools with enrollments just above the cutoff, which would bias the results.)
270  
 
• Martin West and Paul Peterson examined the effect on a Florida 
public school of receiving an F grade on the state’s A+ Accounta-  
 262. La Vigne et al.’s Florida study, see supra  notes 103–110 and accompanying text, deals with two 
different prisons, but even here, there is only one per gender. The O’Connor et al. and Johnson et al. 
studies, see supra notes 179–203 and accompanying text, do disc uss a few prisons. So does OPPAGA’s 
FCBI study, see infra notes 291–301  and accompanying text.

bility Plan.271 Students at schools that received an F twice would get 
a voucher for private school; F schools were also assigned a team to 
write an intervention plan for the school.272 In 2002, Florida 
changed its evaluation system so that most schools received a dif-ferent grade than the previous year.
273 To isolate the effect of an 
F—separate from the effect of being subject to a voucher threat—the authors focused only on the 24 schools that hadn’t previously gotten an F, that wouldn’t  have gotten an F under the old system, 
but that did get an F under the new system.
274 They compared these 
schools to all D schools whose scores were close to those of the 24 F schools.
275 They found that getting an F had a significant positive 
effect on student achievement.276 The same was true for D schools, 
as compared to C schools.277 
 
There are many more examples.278 Exogenous policy s hocks are another 
way of dealing with self-selection: If we compare an entire  prison before 
the introduction of a faith-based program with the same  prison after the 
introduction of the program, we don’t have  to deal with self-selection issues 
as long as people don’t choose which prison they go to, and as long as the 
assignment mechanism didn’t change once the program was introduced. 
Or we could compare a prison with a faith-based program to a prison 
without one, though one would want to be  sure that the two prisons are real-
ly comparable. Again, the comparison would have to be between entire  
prisons since limiting the set at one prison to participants would introduce 
self-selection issues. 
Or one could merge the two approaches and observe how the difference  
between two prisons changed when a fa ith-based program was introduced at 
one of them. This would essentially be a differences-in-differences ap-
proach. 
So the exogenous policy shock appr oach seems promising for faith-
based prisons. This is another area where prison researchers could learn from education researchers. 
B. Using Rejected Volunteers 
I will now discuss the studies that use rejected volunteers as the control 
group. Unsuccessful applicants seem like the best control group, but in fact

they’re not completely ideal. For inst ance, there may be nonrandom attrition 
from the program. “[I]f the more motivated parents among the unsuccessful 
applicants were more likely to enroll their child in a private school outside 
of the choice program”—where statistics aren’t being kept—the unsuccess-ful applicants group would look worse, and the estimate of the effect of getting a voucher would be inflated.
279 
There may be other issues, like exceptions to random assignment—a 
“sibling” rule for schools,280 or allowing some rejected students to enter 
from waiting lists after the beginning of the year—or just lack of oversight 
of the random selection process. Some analysts, like John F. Witte, have therefore concluded that the rejected a pplicants approach is worse than in-
strumental variables or even than sta ndard approaches that don’t control for 
selection.
281 
But even if one concludes that reject ed applicant groups aren’t ideal for 
schools, the problems seem much less in prisons. The attrition in favor of schools outside the system doesn’t seem  so problematic in the prison con-
text since both the successful and the rej ected applicants are, so to speak, a 
captive audience. The same goes for sib ling rules. Oversight of the random 
selection process is still important, but overall, it seems like rejected appli-
cant studies of faith-based prisons are substantially better than the other 
studies to date. (And other methods th at take selection on unobservables 
into account, like instrumental variable s or exogenous policy shocks, simply 
haven’t been attempted for faith-based prisons.) 
The first few studies below find no positive effect of faith-based pro-
grams; the next few do find some effect.

ent groups: (1) a “match group” of 1,754 inmates who “met IFI selection 
criteria but did not participate in the program,” (2) a “screened group” of 
1,083 inmates who “were screened as eligible for the program but did not 
volunteer or were not selected for progr am participation,” and (3) a “volun-
teer group” of 560 inmates who “actually volunteered for the IFI program, but did not participate, either because they were not classified as minimum-out custody, their remaining sentence le ngth was either too short or too long 
to be considered, or they were not returning to the Houston area following 
release.”
284 Of these three groups, only the third avoids selection bias. 
IFI participants did no better than th e other groups in either two-year re-
arrest or reincarceration rates. Two-year re-arrest rates were 36.2% for the IFI group, compared to 35% for the match group, 34.9% for the screened group, and 29.3% for the volunteer group.
285 Two-year reincarceration rates 
were 24.3% for the IFI group, compared to 20.3% for the match group, 
22.3% for the screened group, and 19.1% for the volunteer group.286 
It’s true that IFI graduates  had lower re-arrest (17.3%) and reincarcera-
tion (8.0%) rates.287 But IFI’s definition of “graduation” is “quite restric-
tive” and includes completing 16 months in the IFI program, completing 6 months in aftercare, and holding a job and having been an active member in 
church for the 3 months before graduation.
288 Inmates could be removed 
from the program “for disciplinary purposes,” “at the request of IFI staff,” “for medical problems,” and “at the voluntary request of the applicant.”
289 
The set of inmates who “graduated” fr om the program is thus tainted by 
self-selection (the decision to participate), selection by the program staff 
(the decision not to expel), and “success bias” (the decision to finish the 
program, which in this case even includes a post-release component).290

Some of these programs were institu tion-wide, “offered to all inmates,” 
and “incorporated into the facility’s mission.”292 These programs included 
Bible study groups, Native American prayer, parenting skills, and yoga 
classes,293 so they really don’t count as “faith-based prisons” as we are us-
ing the term here.294 
Other programs were dorm-based; the dorms were “established as . . . 
enclave communit[ies] within the prison compound.”295 The dorm-based 
programs “provide a more intensive experience than the prison-wide pro-
grams”296 and look more like the faith-based prisons that we have been dis-
cussing. 
The authors compared 1,293 inmates released from a faith- and charac-
ter-based institution  with 2,283 inmates who had requested transfer to such 
an institution but weren’t pl aced there before their release.297 They also 
compared 1,311 inmates released from a faith- and character-based dorm  
with 9,988 inmates who had requested tr ansfer to such a dorm but weren’t 
placed there before their release.298 (The study doesn’t say why the compar-
ison inmates weren’t accepted.)299 
For the institution-wide programs, the study found that inmates’ relative 
risk of reoffending ranged from 0.85 to 0.95 relative to the comparison 
group, depending on the institution.300 The authors found no positive effect 
of the dorm-based programs—on the contrary, the relative risk of reoffend-ing for inmates released from such dorms was 1.03 relative to the compari-son group.

group of 10 and a control group of 28.304 
There were no infractions in the treatment group, and 17 infractions in

significant, but the authors wrote that “t he sample size in this study is too

4. Hercik et al.’s Kairos Horizon Study 
Jeanette Hercik and her coauthors eval uated the effect of participation 
in the Kairos Horizon Communities in Prison program at Florida’s Tomoka Prison.
307 
The authors considered 413 inmates who participated in any of the first 
five classes of the program.308 (Class One ran from November 1999 to Oc-
tober 2000; Class Two ran from May 2000 to April 2001; and so on.)309 
First, participants were compared against their previous selves. After 
the treatment started, the proportion of participants with at least one discip-line report dropped from 24.4% to 12.3%, and this proportion remained in the 12–17% range through three years after the start of treatment (two years after the end of treatment).
310 Similarly, the proportion of participants with 
at least one segregation stay dropped from 20.6% to 10.6%, and this propor-
tion hovered around 15–16% through three years after the start of treatment, with a blip up to 18.2% in the 25–30-month range.
311 
Next, the 157 participants in Classes Four and Five were compared 
against two different groups: a “M atched Comparison” group of 157 in-
mates who were eligible but didn’t ap ply, and a “Waiting List Comparison” 
group of 248 inmates who were eligible and did apply.312 From the start of 
treatment, the proportion of the treatment sample with at least one discipline 
report was lower than for either of the comparison samples (14% versus 
25% and 31%, respectively), and the proportion stayed lower through two 
years after the start of treatment,313 though this differen ce wasn’t significant

past the 12-month mark.314 Similarly, the proportion of the treatment sample 
with at least one segregation stay was lower than for either of the compari-
son samples (13% versus 26% and 25 %, respectively), and the proportion 
stayed lower through two years after the start of treatment; these differences were all significant.
315 
The probability of re-arrest of pa rticipants during the follow-up period 
(19.0% among those released during the study period) was greater than that of the matched comparison group (15. 2%) and basically the same as that of 
the waiting list group (19.6%).
316 Program participation may be associated 
with a somewhat longer time for re-arr est (3.5 months for the treatment 
sample, 1.4 months for the matched comparison group, and 3.2 months for the waiting list comparison group), but th e standard deviations are so large 
that I doubt that these differences are significant.
317 
The matched comparison sample is subject to self-selection bias,318 and 
the comparison of participants to their previous selves is probably also bi-ased because those who choose to par ticipate probably have a greater res-
ponsiveness to the material. So the waiting list comparison group is the most valid control group. For this group, while the difference in discipline reports and segregation stays may be si gnificant, participation seems to con-
fer no significant advantage in the probability of re-arrest.

Leon Wilson and his coauthors prepared an unpublished report on an 
ex-prisoner aftercare program, the De troit Transition of Prisoners (TOP) 
program.

A group of 135 former inmates who participated320 was compared to a 
139-member designated control group,321 mainly composed of former in-
  
 314. This isn’t reported in the study but can be cal culated from the authors’ raw data. The difference 
between the treatment group and the waiting list comp arison group is only significant at the 5% level 
through the 12-month mark. The difference between the treatment group and the matched comparison 
group is only significant at the 5% level through th e 12-month mark and in the 19–24-month period, but 
the matched comparison group isn’t a good comparison group in any event. See infra  text accompanying

comprised of ex-prisoners who had some contact w ith the Detroit TOP program  but received no services. 
Contact is defined as having completed the applicatio n process and the screening materials inclusive of 
the LSI-R inventory.” W ILSON ET AL ., supra  note 319, at 11. However, there is a subcategory of the

mates who applied but were turned dow n because they didn’t meet the in-
clusion criteria.322 The TOP program was trying to  take people it believed to 
be high risks, so the treatment group was actually estimated to be at higher 
risk for recidivism than the non-treatment group.323 
The recidivism rate was 18% for grad uates, as compared to 57% for the 
control group.324 However, the set of “graduates” is the result of a signifi-
cant weeding-out process.325 Of the 124 initial participants, only 66 re-
mained in the program for six months and only 47 remained after a year.326 
Only 40 graduated from the program; others didn’t complete the one-month 
probationary period, were terminated for rule violations, didn’t participate, 
or just lost contact with the program after applying.327 These groups all had 
recidivism rates much higher than 18%, and even mostly higher than the 57% of the control group.
328 
The study doesn’t give the recidivism rate for the entire population of 
participants. Using the authors’ data from their adjusted regressions, we can 
estimate the recidivism rate at roughly 52% for participants and 57% for the 
control group, which isn’t a significant difference.329 But once we use the 
adjusted recidivism rate, which the authors obtain after controlling for risk rating, age, and education—so the treatment and control groups are more 
comparable—the recidivism rate comes out at roughly 54% for participants 
and 68% for the control group, which is a significant difference.

treatment group called “Lost Contact after application,” id. at 28 tbl.5, even though the previous quota-
tion seems to define these as part of the control gr oup. I assume that, in reality, the control group was 
composed of inmates who applied and r eceived no services because they were rejected ; those who 
applied and were accepted but received no services becau se they lost contact with the program are con-
sidered part of the treatment group. 
 321. Id.  at 28 tbl.5. While most of the paper uses thes e numbers, another table in the paper has other 
numbers: 38 graduates, 113 inmates who had had some contact with the group, and 120 control inmates.

40 according to Table 5, id. at 42), 81% for those terminated for a rule violation (16), 56% for those who 
didn’t complete the probationary period (20), 65% for those who were terminated for lack of participa-
tion (39), and 68% for those who lost contact after a pplication (20). This makes a recidivism rate of 
approximately 52% overall, or 49% if one excludes t hose who lost contact after application. (I’m not 
sure whether those who lost contact after application are part of the control group. See id.  at 40.) Using 
the numbers from Table 6, id. at 43, instead of Table 5, yields 50% or 48%, which isn’t much different. 
 329. Using Pearson’s chi-square test, the significan ce level is about p=0.32 or  p=0.4, depending on 
which numbers one uses.

6. O’Connor et al.’s Detroit TOP Study 
Tom O’Connor and his coauthors ex amined the same Detroit TOP pro-
gram.331 They compared the 60 men who a pplied for and were accepted into 
TOP with two control groups—a set of  109 rejected applicants and a ran-
dom sample of 174 non-applicants who we re at the pre-release centers in-
volved in the program.332 The rejected applicants were rejected for various 
reasons: some were rejected because th ey wouldn’t be living in Detroit, 
some because they had insufficient prior church involvement, and some 
because they had too much time left to serve at the time they applied.333 
Demographic data suggested that th e participating group had the highest 
risk of recidivism, the rejected volunteer group had the next highest risk, and the random sample of non-applicants group had the lowest risk of the three groups.
334 
First, the authors looked at the likelihood of being returned to prison for 
escaping from the pre-release center.335 At least when looking at those with 
three or more felonies, participants did better than rejected volunteers, who did better than the random non-applicants.
336 (On the other hand, the partic-
ipants had, on average, more church  involvement than the rejected appli-
cants.)337 However, participants with less than three prior felonies did worse  
than the rejected volunteers and no better than non-applicants.338 
Next, the authors looked at the likelihoo d of being returned to prison for 
a parole violation or a new crime.339 Unfortunately, at this point the authors 
divided participants into those who stayed with the program and those who were discharged, whether for lack of pa rticipation, inappr opriate conduct, or 
escape.
340 This reintroduces selection. We don’t know what the results 
would have been if the group hadn’t been subdivided. But even with the subdivision of the participating gro up into those who continued and those 
who didn’t, the continuing group and the rejected volunteers group were both “two times less likely to have a pa role violation or new crime than the 
general population of ex-offenders.”
341 Thus, if the group hadn’t been sub-

divided, we probably would have found that participation conferred no ben-
efit over the rejected volunteers.342 
7. Education Studies 
Private school studies have also been able to use control groups of re-
jected applicants, thanks to the adve nt of small-scale voucher programs with 
a limited number of spots. 
Some voucher programs distribute vouchers on a first-come, first-
served basis, so the rejected applicants—the ones who applied too late—
likely differ systematically from those who were accepted.343 (Some of the 
faith-based prison programs above, whic h don’t say how people made it off 
the wait list,344 are potentially vulnerable to this problem.) 
The most recent studies use data from school voucher programs with 
limited slots and random selection of students off the waiting list.345 In prin-
ciple, voucher programs could be problema tic ways of testing private versus 
public school effectiveness. If voucher programs, through the threat of competition, encouraged public schools to improve,
346 a comparative analy-
sis would understate any positive effect of private schools. Fortunately (for private school researchers), voucher programs have, for political purposes, tended to be extremely limited.
347 Some studies have argued that vouchers 
improve public schools,348 but clearly the extent of any improvement is 
  
 342. Another paper by O’Connor and coauthors on  the TOP examined a group of 19 TOP partici-
pants who had completed 18 months in the program. Thomas O’Connor et al., A Model Program for 
Churches and Ex-Offender Reintegration , 28 J.  OFFENDER REHAB ., nos. 1 & 2, 1998, at 107. Over the 
course of their participation in the program, these participants’ mean LSI-R score (which estimates the 
probability of recidi vism) decreased. Id. at 120. But this study didn’t compare participants against any 
other group. Id. Moreover, to the extent it focuses on par ticipants who completed 18 months, it incorpo-
rates two layers of self-selection bias—once for the choice to participate and once more for the choice 
not to drop out.  343. E.g. , Michael Heise et al., Private Vouchers in Indianapolis: The Golden Rule Program , in 
P
RIVATE VOUCHERS , supra  note 92, at 100, 102. 
 344. In the Johnson and Larson study, applicants were  rejected “because they were not classified as 
minimum-out custody, their remaining sentence length wa s either too short or too long to be considered, 
or they were not returning to th e Houston area following release.” J OHNSON & LARSON , supra  note 282, 
at 13; see also  TRUSTY & EISENBERG , supra  note 283, at 20. O’C ONNOR ET AL ., supra  note 331, is 
explicit about why applicants were rejected, see supra  text accompanying note 337. Note that, because 
one reason for rejection was insuffi cient prior church involvement, th ere is still an element of self-
selection. W ILSON ET AL ., supra  note 319, says that applicants were  rejected because they didn’t meet 
the program criteria—and one reason for being rej ected was that the program was seeking out worse 
risks. See supra  text accompanying notes 320–323. The OPPAGA and the Hercik et al. studies say 
nothing about why rejected applicants were rejected. O FFICE OF PROGRAM POL’Y ANALYSIS & GOV’T

much less than it would be if vouchers were more widely adopted. So this 
methodological concern shouldn’t worry us much. 
Several papers have analyzed th e Milwaukee Choice program, using 
unsuccessful applicants as their comparison group. Jay Greene and his coau-thors found that private schools produced significant gains in math scores in students’ third and fourth years in th e program, though no significant effects 
for reading.
349 (It’s plausible that school reforms would improve math more 
than reading, since math is learned primarily in school while reading is also 
practiced outside of school.)350 John F. Witte found no significant effects for 
reading and weak effects for math.351 Cecilia Rouse found no consistent 
effects for reading; for math, there see med to be some effects, but not until 
two years after application, and some  other specifications yielded no signif-
icant differences until the fourth year.352 However, all three of these papers 
were apparently based on inaccurate test score data.353 Greene and his coau-
thors, using a corrected data set, found significant effects on math scores starting three years in and significant effects on reading scores three or four years in.
354 
Paul Peterson and his coauthors analyzed the New York City School 
Choice Scholarships program.355 They found that being offered a voucher 
had a positive and significant effect on both math and reading scores, at 
least in grades four and five.356 
Outside of the public-private school debate, Alan Krueger used a re-
jected-applicants approach in concl uding that smaller class sizes increased 
average performance on standardized tests.357 
A few studies have merged the unsuccessful-applicants approach and 
the instrumental-variables approach. No t all successful applicants enroll in 
choice schools,358 so if one uses a rejected-applicants approach, one 
shouldn’t compare the rejected applicants with people who actually  use the 
program—that would reintroduce self-selection. Rather, one should com-
pare the rejected applicants with the successful applicants, regardless of 
whether they used the program. The measured effect isn’t the true effect of

actually attending a choice school. Instead, one should interpret the estimate 
as an “intention-to-treat” effect ra ther than as a “treatment” effect.359 
This is a good approach, since offering  the voucher is “the only policy 
instrument available to policy makers,” who after all can’t force parents to remove their children from public schools.
360 (This point also applies to 
faith-based prisons.) Still, one may be interested in the actual effect of at-tending a choice school, particularly if one is a parent. To solve the self-selection problem in the choice whether to attend a choice school, one can 
use an instrumental-variables approach , using whether one gets a voucher to 
predict whether one attends a choice school. 
Cecilia Rouse took this approach with the Milwaukee voucher program 
and found that attending a voucher school raised math scores by about 3 percentile points (an estimate she thought overstated the true effect of the 
program) and had no effect on reading scores.
361 Paul Peterson and William 
Howell took the same approach with the voucher programs in New York City, Dayton, and Washington, D.C., and found significant achievement gains among African-Americans, immediat ely in the case of New York City 
and in the second year in the case of Dayton and Washington, D.C.
362 In 
other work, Peterson and his coauthors found that switching to a private 
school had a significant effect, at least after the first year, for African-
Americans, but no significant effect for other ethnic groups.363 
IV. CONCLUSION  
So, after discarding the faith-based prison studies tainted by self-
selection bias, we’re left with two studi es that find no effect of faith-based 
programs,364 one study that’s too small to be meaningful,365 and three stu-
dies that find some  effect, even if the effect that a few of these find is quite 
weak.366 And of those three, two aren’t about prisoners at all, but about af-
ter-care of released prisoners,367 and the remaining one shows no significant 
effect once the prisoners have been released.368 So we have no study that

actually finds a significant effect of an in-prison faith-based program on 
recidivism.369 
The picture looks fairly bleak for faith-based prisons. (Of course, this 
analysis has no bearing on arguments in favor of religious prisons that don’t 
hinge on their value in reducing recidivism.)370 
Several literature reviews agree. On e says the faith-based prison re-
search  
has shown only moderate effects of faith-based programs on out-
come measures such as institutiona l adjustment, incidence of prison 
infractions, and likelihood of postrel ease arrest. This literature also 
suffers, in some cases, from important limitations such as: small and nonrepresentative samples, a re liance on anecdotal evidence, an 
absence of theoretical context, lim ited statistical analysis, and self-
evaluation by prison ministry providers.
371  
Another review says that “research on intentional religion is remarkably 
underdeveloped” and that “[c]ase studies and descriptive studies,” dominat-ed by “subjective interpretations,” are “clearly over-represented,” and calls for the use of “more rigorous methodologies.”
372 
One major contributor to the faith-b ased prison literature is even more 
pessimistic about the “more in-depth  faith-based programs,” calling “the 
current trend . . . to put large sums of money and a great deal of public, po-litical, and criminological emphasis” on such programs “mistaken” and ar-
guing that there is no evidence that su ch programs are better than other cor-
rectional treatment programs.
373 
I agree, though I emphasize the self-selection issue more than the other 
problems. (Indeed, I haven’t even in cluded any anecdotal evidence here 
because I find it to be of extremely limited [i.e., no] value.) 
Is there any hope for the future? I think there may be. Not all faith-
based prison programs are the same. Tom O’Connor and Jeff Duncan write 
that various programs that showed no effect374 “probably did a good job of 
faith development but failed to reduce recidivism because they did not fol-
  
 369. In addition, there is Camp et al.’ s propensity score study described above, see text accompany-
ing supra  notes 204–212, which finds a small but significan t effect of participation on serious in-prison 
misconduct. Whether this study is credible depends on how much one trusts the self-reported motivation 
score that the authors use.

low what are known as the principles of effective correctional treatment, 
such as criminogenic risk/need, responsivity, family/community context, 
program integrity, and program delivery type.”375 On the other hand, they 
write, the COSA376 and TOP377 programs worked because they did follow 
many of these principles.378 Similarly, Daniel Mears and his coauthors write 
that many faith-based programs have failed because they haven’t “articu-late[d] a clear statement of program goals and how exactly specific activi-ties will contribute to these goals”; activ ities have been inconsistently im-
plemented; the different organizations  and agencies involved have been 
uncoordinated; and funding has been insufficient or inconsistent.
379 
If this is the case, the failures of certain faith-based programs may not 
indicate that the faith-based agenda itself is flawed. Later programs may do better; experimentation may result in the discovery of a more effective 
model; the programs that have worked well may be replicated in more plac-
es. The weak evidence sup porting faith-based prisons so far may mean that 
more experimentation is in order, pr ovided such experimentation can be 
done consistent with constitutional c onstraints. “The process of accumulat-
ing empirical evidence is rarely sexy in the unfolding, but accumulation is the necessary road along which results become more general.”
380 
Moreover, I’m hopeful that—now that studies are available in each of 
these categories, and now that a number of critical review articles (including this one) have appeared—faith-based prison researchers will get the hint and pursue valid empirical techniques. They’ll be following in a venerable 
tradition. According to economists Josh ua Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, 
empirical economics is going through a “credibility revolution.”
381 “[T]he 
primary engine driving improvement,” Angrist and Pischke write, “has been 
a focus on the quality of empirical research designs.”382 Randomized as-
signment has been part of the story383—we’ve now seen a few faith-based 
prison studies that used this very approach in the form of using rejected 
volunteers as a control group. Another part of the story is “natural experi-
ments” or “quasi-experimental” designs where we observe people’s res-ponses to random institutional flukes; this approach hasn’t been used so far 
for faith-based prisons, but we’ve seen it for education in the “exogenous 
policy shocks” literature.

better than it was: researchers proposing an instrument now typically take 
seriously the need to justify why a particular instrument is valid.385

Can such experimentation be done c onsistent with constitutional con-
straints? As I’ve mentioned above,386 one faith-based prison program, Pris-
on Fellowship Ministries’ InnerChange Freedom Initiative, was struck down 
on Establishment Clause grounds in 2006,387 so at least some faith-based 
programs are vulnerable. 
As I explain elsewhere,388 a constitutional faith-based prison program 
will have to comply with the following requirements: 
 
• Its religious content must be significantly watered down, so that one 
can’t find “religious indoctrination.” 
• It must be chosen by a process that is neutral as between religious 
and non-religious programs. Thus, the process that chose it must have been capable of selecting a secular program. 
• There must be at least one, and possibly several, comparable secular 
programs. 
• The program must not only be formally voluntary but also not offer 
significantly greater benefits—for instance, a greater possibility of 
parole or a safer environment—than secular alternatives. 
• Program officials must, at a minimum, not play any role in main-
taining order or meting out discipline. But even divesting oneself of these governmental roles may not be  good enough to avoid uncons-
titutionality. 
 
The more ecumenical programs—like the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ 
Life Connections program, which looks  much more like an outgrowth of 
traditional chaplaincy programs together  with visits by “spiritual guides of 
different faiths”
389—may yet turn out to be constitutional, but it’s easy to 
imagine that some of the more “har d-core” advocates of faith-based prisons 
will be disappointed at this prospect. To many, salvation (and, in this world, 
rehabilitation) comes through Christ (for instance) alone, so that a rehabilit-
ative program that isn’t allowed to use specifically Christian material may not even be worthwhile. Moreover, program administrators may want to hold on to the ability to expel inmate s who aren’t engaging constructively

with the material, and the ability to tell  an inmate where he can live, or to 
withdraw some privileges from an in mate, may be “governmental” enough 
to be unconstitutional when put into th e hands of a religious organization, 
unless the religious organization was chosen by a strictly neutral process that could also choose secular organizations. 
In other work, I explain how a system of prison vouchers would solve 
these constitutional problems. Instead of being assigned to prisons, con-victed criminal defendants would receive a voucher, good for one impri-
sonment, that they would be required to redeem at a participating prison.
390 
Any organization, religious or secular, would be able to run a prison, pro-
vided it complied with certain minima l security-based requirements (related 
to, for instance, the number of guards,  the medical facilities, the food, or 
physical security).391 This system, combining inmate choice with strict gov-
ernment neutrality as between secular and religious providers, is consistent 
with the Establishment Clause for the same reasons that school choice plans 
are constitutional, as explained in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris .392 
Of course, a full policy analysis of prison voucher programs is compli-
cated, and I don’t attempt it here.393 The full cost-benefit analysis goes far 
beyond religious matters and the ques tion of faith-based prisons. On the 
plus side, prison vouchers would finally give prisons an incentive to com-
pete on dimensions that are valuable to  prisoners and pris on reformers alike, 
such as decent medical care or low ra tes of assault or rape. On the negative 
side, it would also give prisons an incentive to compete on socially negative dimensions, like looking the other way as prisoners smuggled in contra-
band, or, more generally, to the exte nt that prisons become more pleasant 
places from inmates’ points of view, the deterrent value of prison would be lessened. 
The positives and negatives are both su bstantial, and I remain agnostic 
about whether prison vouchers are a se nsible reform proposal. I only men-
tion it here, by way of conclusion, as a possible way to allow experimenta-
tion with faith-based prisons to proceed without the specter of unconstitu-tionality.

There remains another problem. Generally, all we know about the com-
parison groups in the studies described here is that they’re composed of people who didn’t participate in the program. We don’t know what treat-
ment, if any, they received. Suppose, for instance, they received no treat-
ment at all. The study may thus be measuring the effect of treatment re-

sources, not the effect of the program’s religious content. It may be that a 
faith-based program is better than nothing —this is important because “the 
lack of reentry programming constitutes a common criticism of reentry 
practices to date.”394 But, at the same time, the program may be no better 
than a comparably funded secular program—which is problematic for poli-cymakers deciding which of several programs to fund. To answer this ques-tion, we would need a comparison group of volunteers who were rejected from the religious program and instead assigned to a comparable secular 
program. To my knowledge, such a study hasn’t been done. 
The reality, of course, is that most prisoners don’t  get comparable pro-
grams. Nor do they all get nothing. Many prisoners “in fact participate in one or more community-based services, ev en if the intensity of these servic-
es may be nominal.”
395 So perhaps the best comparison is to this “business 
as usual” approach.396 But that, too, is difficult since the “business as usual” 
baseline differs from place to place and over time.397 
This problem, while real, is less serious than the self-selection problem. 
The trouble with self-selection is that a program that seems to work may in fact be worthless. In fact, a program may appear to work even when it’s 
positively harmful, as long as the self-selection effect in the other direction 
is strong enough. 
On the other hand, the resources problem tells us that a faith-based pro-
gram may be no better, and possibly worse, than some secular program. But where will this program come from? The reality for many prison adminis-trators is that the alternative to a religious program sometimes is nothing at 
all. Religious providers may just be more available than secular providers, 
and may also cost less to the prison system to the extent that they’re more likely to be subsidized by donations from the outside. 
Moreover, if one did compare a religious program against a specific se-
cular program, it would thus answer a specific  question of comparative ef-
fectiveness, and would be useful to people considering the hypothetical 
question of where social resources could, in principle, be best spent. But this result would be hard to generalize to  comparisons with other secular pro-
grams, and moreover, it would be false to the actual choices faced by prison administrators today.

 Let’s take the broad view and come back to the education studies that 
I’ve been using as a point of comparison throughout this Article.

2011] Faith-Based Prisons  95 
Finally, after decades of research, we have some credible studies esti-
mating the effect of private schools. The best evidence, taken from studies 
comparing accepted and rejected applicants, indicates that private schools 
do have a positive effect on the students who attend them, at least for black 
students and at least for math scores.399 
On the one hand, one can observe that , next to these results (modest as 
they are), it’s all the more disappointing that faith-based prisons haven’t shown much in the way of significant positive effects. 
But on the other hand, it took decades of research and debate by differ-
ent groups, each using a slightly different empirical approach—and many finding little to no effect—before we got even the mild results we have on private education.
400 This suggests that we should encourage more research 
on the matter, in different contexts, us ing a variety of different empirical 
techniques. 
The result is that, if there’s no str ong reason to believe that faith-based 
prisons work at all, and even less reason to believe that they work better than comparably funded secular program s, there’s also little reason to be-
lieve that they don’t  work, and in many cases they may be the only available 
alternative. It’s probably sensible to allow such programs to operate and to 
allow the process of experimentation to work its course, provided that all 
this can be done constitutionally. 
  
 399. See supra  Part II.A.6. 
 400. One could also be somewhat depressed that so many empirical studies have failed to yield 
consistent results across the board. Oh well, empirical research is messy.
